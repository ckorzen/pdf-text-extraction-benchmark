Introduction

The interaction of planetary nebulae PNs) with the interstellar medium ISM) was first discussed by Gurzadyan 1969). Smith 1976) used the thin shell model to analyze the evolution of a spherically symmetric expanding PN shell moving through the ISM see also Isaacman 1979). On the observational side, only a few PNs showed interaction with the ISM hereafter refereed to as interacting PNs) until the last decade. With better observational imaging instruments CCD cameras) the field interacting PNs became more popular e.g., Borkowski, Tsvetanov,  Harrington 1993; Jacoby  Van de Steene 1995; Tweedy, Martos  Noriega-Crespo 1995; Hollis et al. 1996; Zucker  Soker 1997). Borkowski, Sarazin  Soker 1990;hereafter BSS) discuss the potential in using interacting PNs to probe the ISM, and list many interacting and possibly interacting PNs. This list was extended in the review article by Tweedy 1995) and in the atlas of interacting PNs Tweedy  Kwitter 1996). Tweedy with several collaborators has been leading the observational research in the field e.g., Tweedy  Kwitter 1994a,b; Tweedy  Napiwotzki 1994). Other studies are in progress, and preliminary results were presented in the conference e.g. Kerber et al. 2000; Dopita et al. 2000 

[38;5;1m=[0mOn the theoretical side, Soker, Borkowski  Sarazin 1991;hereafter SBS) performed numerical simulations, both in the isothermal and adiabatic limits. Their results validate the thin-shell approximation of Smith 1976). In the adiabatic case they found that the Rayliegh-Taylor RT) instability plays a crucial role in the evolution. Recent numerical calculations reported in this conference Dopita et al. 2000; Villaver et al. 2000) confirmed these results. In their observational analysis of the interacting PN IC 4593, Zucker  Soker 1993) suggested that the interaction process oscillates between the adiabatic and isothermal cases. An analytical study of this process, the so-called radiative shock overstability, was performed by Dgani  Soker 1994) for finite-sized objects e.g., spherical nebulae). The radiative overstability was found to occur only [38;5;1m1[0m

For an earlier review of the theory see Dgani(1995). Several recent theoretical studies were conducted since that review. Soker  Dgani 1997) studied analytically the interaction of PNs with a magnetized ISM. Dgani  Soker 1998) and Dgani(1998) discussed the role of instabilities in the interaction. New numerical studies are underway Villaver et al. 2000; Dopita et al. 2000), preliminary results presented in the conference show that instabilities play an important role in the interaction.

Preliminary Considerations

[38;5;1m=[0mWhy is the interaction important?

The interaction of PNs with the ISM causes deviation form axisymmetry or point symmetry). Several other processes that cause deviation from axisymmetry involving binaries were discussed by Soker and collaborators e.g. Soker 1994; Soker 1996; Soker et al 1998).

[38;5;1m=[0mIt is important to understand as accurately as possible the ISM effects on the morphology and to distinguish them from other processes.

[38;5;1m=[0mInteracting PNs are also a tool for studying the ISM. This role was emphasized in previous reviews Tweedy 1995; Dgani 1995).

[38;5;1m2.2.[0m

Detecting the interaction

The interaction can be divided into at least three phases: free expansion, deceleration and stripping off the central star. Initially, PNs expand freely because their densities are of orders of magnitude higher than the densities of their surrounding medium. Eventually, though, every nebula will reach a stage in which the pressure inside the nebula is of the same order as the pressure outside the nebula. A strong enough pressure wave will then propagate into the nebula and decelerate it. If the nebula moves supersonically, the dominant ISM pressure is the ram pressure. The critical density ncrit, at which the ISM and the nebula reach the same pressure is BSS, Eq. 1):

[90m[formula][0m

where c is the isothermal sound speed in the nebula, c     10 km s- 1 in most cases, v* is the velocity of the central star, ve is the expansion velocity of the nebula and n0 is the ISM density. The most difficult parameter to observe directly in the above formula is the ISM density, n0. The nebula at this early stage of the interaction is not distorted, but its leading edge is brighter. Measuring the value of the density at the leading edge, ncrit, and using the above formula yields an estimate for n0.

[38;5;1m=[0mIf we take the average value of ve     20 km s- 1 Weinberger 1989) and v*     60 km s- 1 Pottash 1984; BSS), then ncrit  60n0. As the ISM ram pressure [48;5;167mInteraction of Planetary Nebulae with the Interstellar Medium[90m(#S:0,#M:0)[0m[48;5;167m[0m

[38;5;1m|[0mdepends on the velocity squared, the interaction is much stronger for fast moving planetaries. For example, if v*     150 km s- 1 then the critical density is about 300 times that of the ISM.

[38;5;1m=[0mThe electron number density of extended planetaries is about 100 cm- 3 Kaler 1983) for the low surface brightness PNs from the NGC catalog, and 10 cm- 3 for the fainter PNs from the Abell 1966) catalog. The very large nebula S-216 has ne    5 cm- 3. In principle, therefore, fast moving planetary nebulae can be detected in very low density environments [90m[[0m[38;5;1mn0  0.01.[0m

Numerical Models

The first realistic models of moving PNs were calculated numerically by SBS. They performed hydrodynamic simulations of the PN-ISM interaction with the particle in cell PIC) method in cylindrical symmetry. They calculated two types of models of thick nebular shells moving through the ISM: an adiabatic model which applies to fast nebulae moving in the galactic halo and an isothermal model relevant to average nebulae moving in the galactic plane.

[38;5;1m3.1.[0m

Cooling in the ISM shock

A nebula moving supersonically in the ISM creates a strong bow shock before it. The cooling time of the shocked ISM gas depends on the ionization state of the gas before the shock. The following analytical formula for the cooling time is based on numerical calculations of a steady shock with ionization precursor. It is accurate within a factor of 2 for vs    60 km s- 1 Mckee 1987):

[90m[formula][0m

In steady state shocks with velocities of about 50 km s- 1, the cooling drops by a factor of 10 when the material is preionized Raymond 1979). However, the cooling time is still shorter than the flow time for an average nebula moving in the galactic plane. Only when the relative velocity is high and the density is low, will an adiabatic flow appear.

[38;5;1m3.2.[0m

The adiabatic model

SBS choose the parameters for the adiabatic model so that the cooling time is larger than the flow time. An instability appears near the axis while the shell is decelerating which is interpreted as a Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the decelerated shell. When the shocked ISM cannot cool, the deceleration of the dense nebular shell by the dilute shocked ISM is Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. The main morphological features of the adiabatic flow are the ISM shock front, the decelerated PN shell and the RT instability. The last manifests itself as a bump" and a hole in the nebula along the upstream symmetry axis. The numerical scheme used by SBS, though, being of 2D cylindrically symmetric nature and limited spatial resolution, forces the fastest growing mode to be of large wavelength and near the symmetry axis. Similar instability modes are obtained in numerical simulations of other types of dense bodies moving through an ambient media Brighenti  D'Ercole 1995 for Wolf-Rayet ring nebulae, and Jones, Hyesung  [48;5;167m4[90m(#S:0,#M:0)[0m[48;5;167m[0m

[38;5;1m3.3.[0m

The isothermal model

In the isothermal model, efficient cooling is assumed. The cooling is calculated in the following way: for every cell in which the temperature is more than [90m[[0m[38;5;1m104 K[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22m104K[0m[90m][0m the temperature is set equal to [90m[[0m[38;5;1m104 K.[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22m104K.[0m[90m][0m. The model parameters are typical for an average nebula moving in the galactic plane.

[38;5;1m=[0mIn this case the shocked region is thin and arms" of denser ISM material follow the nebula. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability does not appear in this case. This is because the shocked ISM is cooled and its density is of the same order as the nebular density. The model agrees with the thin shell approximation of Smith.

[38;5;1m3.4.[0m

Recent numerical simulations.

Numerical simulations show that several types of instabilities which develop on the interface of spherically expanding shells or winds) moving with respect to the ISM can fragment the shells e.g. Brighenti  D'Ercole 1995  The detailed 2D numerical simulations of Brighenti  D'Ercole 1995) nicely show how RT and KH instabilities on the interface of the wind and the ISM develop, and allow the ISM to penetrate into the wind-bubble.

[38;5;1m=[0mNew numerical studies of interacting PNs are underway Villaver et al. 2000; Dopita et al. 2000). Preliminary results presented in the conference show that the RT instabilities can fragment the nebular shell and allow the ISM to penetrate to the inner parts of the nebulae in some cases.

The Role of the ISM Magnetic Field in Interacting PNs

The important role of the ISM magnetic field on shaping interacting PNs was first mentioned in the observational paper of Tweedy et al 1995) about the nebula Sh 216. The morphology of the nebula is dominated by a bow shock followed by several parallel elongated filaments. Tweedy et al. 1995) noted that the magnetic pressure of the ISM is negligible compared to its ram pressure for the assumed central star velocity v*    20 km s- 1). They have argued that the central star velocity must be very low i.e. v*    5 km s- 1 in order to explain the magnetic shaping of the nebula. Dgani  Soker 1998; table 1) noted that too many interacting PNs a dozen) show signs of magnetic shaping i.e. parallel elongated filaments. It is very unlikely that all of them have such abnormally low central star velocity.

The magnetic Rayliegh-Taylor instability for galactic plane PNs

The isothermal case case 1) is the more typical for the majority of PNs, moving moderately fast [90m[formula][0m close to the galactic plain, where the ISM density is relatively high. Soker et al. 1991) find in their numerical simulations that the isothermal model shows no sign of the RT instability. Soker  Dgani 1997) show the ISM magnetic field, which was not incorporated in the numerical simulations of Soker et al. 1991), can lead to an interesting manifestation of the RT instability in the isothermal case case 1). We assume that there is a magnetic field of intensity Bs in the shocked ISM, but not in the nebula, and that its field lines are parallel to the boundary separating the ISM and nebular material. The acceleration g deceleration in the frame of the central star) of the nebular front pointing downstream) is in the opposite direction to the density gradient. In the linear regime the growth rate of the RT instability, σ, with a wavenumber k    2π    λ, is given by e.g., Priest 1984;  7.5.2)

[38;5;1m=[0mThe magnetic field has a destabilizing effect only for modes having wave numbers close to being perpendicular to the field lines and in the plane separating the ISM and the nebula). Instability modes having wave numbers along the field lines are suppressed by the magnetic tension. This effect may create elongated structures in the direction of the magnetic field lines.

The morphology of interacting PNs and their galactic latitude

Dgani  Soker 1998) explore the observational consequences of the development of RT in galactic plane PNs moving in a magnetized ISM. In order to define the galactic plane and galactic halo population we use the expression for the cooling time after the ISM shock eq. 2). The cooling will be effective when the flow time of shocked ISM around the nebula [90m[[0m[38;5;1mtf low[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mtflow[0m[90m][0m    R  v* is longer than the cooling time. Calling the ratio of the two times η, we obtain:

[90m[formula][0m

Halo PNs are expected to have a speed of [90m[formula][0m through the ISM, while those in the plane move much slower. In addition, close to the galactic plane the density is higher than in the halo. We therefore expect that halo PNs will have η    1 and therefore the flow will be adiabatic, while for disk PNs η    1 and the flow will be isothermal. Several high quality observations, most notably given in the Atlas published by Tweedy  Kwitter 1996) provide us with a sample of 34 deep images of interacting PNs. In table 1 of Dgani  Soker 1998), we give a list of the objects and their references. Some nebulae have several parallel stripes. We define a nebula as striped only if it has at least two parallel long filaments. All of the 12 striped nebulae are close to the galactic plane z|  250 pc). The fact that the striped nebulae are confined to the galactic plane is compatible with [48;5;167mInteraction of Planetary Nebulae with the Interstellar Medium[90m(#S:0,#M:0)[0m[48;5;167m[0m

[38;5;1m|[0mthe the prediction that RT will be effective for galactic plane PNs moving in the warm medium, because of magnetic effects, but only for modes perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. The result is elongated structures or RT rolls". For galactic halo interacting PNs the cooling is inefficient and magnetic pressure is negligible. RT will be effective but it will form fingers or blobs and not stripes.

Measuring the ISM magnetic field with interacting PNs

The group of 12 nebulae that show stripes is not homogeneous; some have thick loose stripes, some have thin densely packed stripes. In Dgani 1998) the properties of the striped nebulae and their application to the study of the ISM are explored. In particular, a simple model for the shocked ISM region is used to derive a relation between the distance between adjacent stripes and the strength of the magnetic field of the ISM. If [90m[[0m[38;5;1mz[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mΔz[0m[90m][0m is the average spacing of the stripes in units of the radius of the nebula then see Dgani 1997, eq. 4):

[90m[formula][0m

where vA0 is the Alfven speed in the ISM, α0 is the angle between the pre-shock magnetic field and the shock front, and v* is the velocity of the central star. According to the formula nebulae with densely packed stripes either move faster or move in a weaker magnetic field than the ones with thicker looser stripes. Applying this simple formula to several striped nebulae, Dgani shows that information about the strength of the ISM magnetic field in the local neighborhood of these nebulae can be extracted by accurate observations of the members of this group.
