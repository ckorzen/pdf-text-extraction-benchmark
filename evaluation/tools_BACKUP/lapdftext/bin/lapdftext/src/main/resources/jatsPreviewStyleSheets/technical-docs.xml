      <title>General overview</title>
      <p>The various tasks performed by stylesheets in this distribution have been distinguished so
        they may be mixed and matched to meet specific local requirements, including:</p>
      <list>
        <list-item>
          <p>Generating HTML, PDF, or XHTML output.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Autoformatting structured citation elements <monospace>(element-citation</monospace>)
            according to different sets of guidelines (we include stylesheets supporting the
            NLM/Pubmed citation style and an APA-like citation style).</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Converting OASIS (CALS/Docbook) tables appearing in JATS documents into HTML (for
            display or conversion to PDF).</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Filtering content based on the values of <monospace>specific-use</monospace> attributes
            assigned to elements in the source data.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>These various operations are performed in stages as follows:</p>
      <def-list>
        <def-item>
          <term>Preprocesses</term>
          <def>
            <p>Preprocesses are all designed to perform operations needed by some processes but not
              others, so they can be excluded when not needed. Generally speaking it is possible to
              run more than one preprocess, as long as they do not directly conflict with one
              another. When they do, it can be expected that the first process in the chain to
              handle a particular element or structure in the input will be the one to take
              effect.</p>
            <p>Some but not all variants of NISO JATS will use OASIS tables instead of HTML tables;
              in support of these, a stylesheet to convert OASIS tables into HTML (which is handled
              by the main preview stylesheets) is also provided as a pre-process. This is documented
              further below.</p>
            <p>All preprocessing stylesheets accept arbitrary (valid) JATS Publishing 1.0 XML and
              emit the same format: they are "modified identity transformations", whose operations
              are limited to a particular subset of elements related to their functional
              requirements. (The OASIS tables stylesheet emits the subset of HTML tables used by
              JATS and recognized by the main stylesheets. The citation preprocessors accept accept
              arbitrary JATS input and produce JATS in "simple citation" form, on which see <xref
                rid="simple-citation">below</xref>.)</p>
            <p>Because some preprocesses perform operations that are not practically achieved in
              modifiable, maintainable XSLT 1.0, they use XSLT 2.0 and require an XSLT 2.0
              processor. Others will work in either an XSLT 1.0 or 2.0 processor.</p>
            <p>Brief descriptions of each preprocess appear below. Additionally, all stylesheets in
              this package are documented internally.</p>
          </def>
        </def-item>
        <def-item>
          <term>Main preview processes</term>
          <def>
            <p>There are two main preview stylesheets in this distribution.
                <monospace>jats-html.xsl</monospace> formats JATS Publishing 1.0 in HTML for display
              in web browsers.<fn>
                <p>Unfortunately, due to tradeoffs forced by discrepancies in their modeling of
                  block vs inline elements in the Journal Publishing tag set and HTML, not all
                  results of the HTML preview stylesheet can be guaranteed to be valid HTML. But
                  none of the known issues have hindered correct rendering in browsers.</p>
              </fn>
              <monospace>jats-xslfo.xsl</monospace> converts JATS Publishing 1.0 XML into XSL
              formatting objects, ready for rendering by an XSL formatting engine into PDF
              output.</p>
            <p>Both main preview stylesheets accept a filtered form of JATS Publishing 1.0, in which
              structured citation elements have been replaced with formatted citations. The
              assumption here is that many processes will need to include some form of citation
              processing in order to format citations in an appropriate style. For purposes of this
              documentation, this filtered form can be called "Simple citation" JATS Publishing 1.0
              (it is specified in more detail below). Some projects may have citations that are
              already formatted using <monospace>mixed-citation</monospace> elements, which provides
              for inline punctuation and hence formatting within the source data. Since all the
              citation preprocessors respect punctuation that is already in place, any of them may
              be used as the preprocessor in such cases.</p>
            <p>If input data should happen already to conform to the "Simple citation" format, a
              citation preprocessor may be dispensed with altogether. Some projects may wish to do
              this — "unbundling" the citation formatting to manage it up front or by different
              means altogether — in order to be able to use a wider range of XSLT processors,
              including XSLT processors in web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox or
              Safari, to render their previews directly. The main preview stylesheets are
              implemented in XSLT 1.0 in order to enable this.</p>
          </def>
        </def-item>
        <def-item>
          <term>Post-process</term>
          <def>
            <p>Some JATS Publishing 1.0 data may include MathML, so the rendering of MathML may be
              an issue. The PDF preview stylesheet simply passes MathML through to be rendered by
              the formatter; many commercial FO engines now support MathML. On the HTML side,
              however, things are more complex since MathML is not supported by generic web browsers
              displaying HTML.</p>
            <p>Some current browsers now support MathML display in XHTML output. For these purposes,
              an HTML to XHTML converter has been provided as a post-process. More details are
              provided below.</p>
          </def>
        </def-item>
      </def-list>
      <sec>
        <title>Stylesheets in this package</title>
        <p>While the preview stylesheets in this distribution are intended as fairly comprehensive
          solutions, the supporting stylesheets may serve simply as demonstrations of how to achieve
          common tasks. Projects should feel free to copy, modify or extend any of them in order to
          support local requirements better.</p>

        <title>Using the provided shell stylesheets and pipelines</title>
        <p>The easiest way to apply either of the preview stylesheets is to use one of the shell
          ("wrapper") stylesheets or XProc pipelines. The shell stylesheets can be run with Saxon,
          the XSLT 2.0 engine, and rely on Saxon-specific extensions to XSLT 2.0; the XProc
          pipelines can be run with any conforming XProc engine that supports XSLT 2.0 stages (no
          extensions are needed). Either process applies a set of transformations in sequence
          quickly, with a minimum of memory or disk overhead. Each one calls one or the other main
          preview stylesheet, with different pre- or postprocessors depending on its intended
          application.</p>
        <p>The Saxon shell stylesheets provided also depend on the module
            <monospace>main/shell-utility.xsl</monospace> to function. This module must be in place,
          and its location in relation to the stylesheets named in the shell must be stable, for
          things to work.</p>
        <p>Because running the XSL-FO Preview stylesheet also entails running an XSL-FO formatter,
          there are slightly different considerations in setting things up for each type of
          output:</p>
        <sec>
          <title>HTML preview pipeline</title>
          <p>Either from the command line or using an XML editor or XML/XSLT IDE, invoke an XProc
            processor with an XProc pipeline, or Saxon with a shell stylesheet, to apply it to a
            Journal Publishing 3.0 file or to a subdirectory of such files. If a DTD is referenced
            by the file, make sure it is available. Place the results in the location of your
            choice. Copy the <monospace>jats-preview.css</monospace> file next to the HTML results.
            You are done.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>XSL-FO preview pipeline</title>
          <p>Two alternatives are available:</p>
          <list>
            <list-item>
              <p>Configure your XSL-FO engine to run a transformation using an XProc engine or
                Saxon, and invoke the transformation from the formatter.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>Run the transformation in the same way as when producing HTML, to generate an XML
                XSL-FO file that can be processed by the XSL-FO formatting engine.</p>
            </list-item>
          </list>
          <p>The tradeoff is that while the first method requires a (one-time) configuration, it is
            easier for the user. It is a common feature of XSL-FO engines to allow configuring them
            to use the XSLT transformation engine of your choice.<fn>
              <p>The Journal Publishing 3.0 XSL-FO preview stylesheet was tested with the
                AntennaHouse XSL formatter, version 4.3. Instructions for configuring AntennaHouse
                to use an alternative XSLT processor can be found in their user documentation; the
                settings to change are under the <bold>Format / Format Option Setting</bold> menu
                option. A tip: test your invocation your processor from the command line first, so
                you can paste accurate settings into the dialog box.</p>
            </fn></p>

      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Extending the Saxon shell stylesheet or writing your own</title>
        <p>The shell stylesheets included in this package all have the same logic. Stylesheets to be
          called in and applied to the source data, in sequence, are named in a variable in the
          stylesheet. Inserting or removing components is as easy as changing this variable.</p>
        <p>For example, the stylesheet <monospace>jats-PMCcit-xhtml.xsl</monospace> has the variable
            <monospace>$processes</monospace> declared as
          follows:<preformat position="anchor">&lt;xsl:variable name="processes">
  &lt;step>../../xslt/citations-prep/jats-PMCcit.xsl&lt;/step>
  &lt;step>../../xslt/preview/jats-html-preview.xsl&lt;/step>
  &lt;step>../../xslt/post/xhtml-ns.xsl&lt;/step>
&lt;/xsl:variable></preformat>Add
          a step to this
          declaration:<preformat position="anchor">&lt;xsl:variable name="processes">
  <bold>&lt;step>../../xslt/prep/jats-webfilter.xsl&lt;/step></bold>
  &lt;step>../../xslt/citations-prep/jats-PMCcit.xsl&lt;/step>
  &lt;step>../../xslt/main/jats-html-preview.xsl&lt;/step>
  &lt;step>../../xslt/post/xhtml-ns.xsl&lt;/step>
&lt;/xsl:variable></preformat>Now,
          an additional preprocess <monospace>prep/jats-webfilter.xsl</monospace> is run before the
          citation preprocessing step.</p>
        <p>Of course, we recommend copying a shell with a new name and making changes there, in
          order to preserve the integrity of files in the distribution.</p>
        <p>All paths given are relative to the shell stylesheet's location in the subdirectory
          structure.</p>
        <p>Note that configuration of the output serialization using the
            <monospace>xsl:output</monospace> instruction is designated by the shell stylesheet.
          Accordingly, a shell stylesheet intended to generate plain HTML might have
            <monospace>method="html"</monospace> indicated in its <monospace>xsl:output</monospace>,
          while a shell stylesheet generating XHTML should have
            <monospace>method="xhtml"</monospace>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Extending an XProc pipeline or writing your own</title>
        <p>Of course, the same possibilities are available when using XProc, with many more. For
          example an XProc pipeline could included DTD or Schematron validation along with
          processing of documents (or only of valid documents, if preferred), processing sets of
          documents together, etc.</p>
        <p>XProc is a W3C-standard XML process pipelining technology, documented on line.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Designing and running your own pipeline</title>
        <p>If you don't want to use XProc or rely on the XSLT extensions supported by Saxon, you can
          build your own pipelines to apply the stylesheets, using the framework of your choice.
          Shell scripts, batch files, scripting languages, and build tools such as Unix
            <monospace>make</monospace> or Apache Ant can all be used for this purpose. The
          principle is simple: each step in the pipeline generates results that are taken as the
          input for the next step in the pipeline. Serialization may follow each step (if each
          pipeline reads its input from the file system) or may be performed only after the last
          step (if steps are connected using event streams or if intermediate results are held in
          memory).</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that an XSLT engine will still be required to run the separate steps, and
          that several of the stylesheets provided do require an XSLT 2.0 processor.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Running without a pipeline</title>
        <p>The stylesheets can also be run individually, without any pipeline automation at all,
          just by applying preprocessor stylesheets to the input, if needed, and then applying the
          appropriate main preview stylesheet to the output from the preprocessors.</p>
        <p>For input that contains no bibliographic citations, or in which all the bibliographic
          citations are pre-formatted and conform to the "simple citation" format defined <xref
            rid="simple-citation">below</xref>, no preprocessors are necessary and the main preview
          stylesheet can be run standalone in any XSLT 1.0 or 2.0 processor (including client-side
          web browsers or other XSLT-capable display engines). </p>
        <p>Note, however, that most JATS input that contains any citations at all will benefit from
          being passed through one of the citation preprocessors, even if all the citations in the
          input are <monospace>mixed-citation</monospace> and have the appropriate punctuation: the
          main preview stylesheets work best if the only elements within citations in the input are
          presentation-oriented elements; the preprocessors strip out all other elements inside of
          citations, and replace them with appropriate presentation-oriented markup. </p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Tweaks and extensions to the main preview stylesheets</title>
      <p>These stylesheets provide for basic formatting of Journal Publishing data for preview; they
        are not designed to serve as production stylesheets. Their functionality can be extended or
        modified, however.<fn>
          <p>The overall architecture of this stylesheet suite, with coverage of approaches to
            customizing it, was described in a paper at JATS-Con 2010. A written version is online
            at <ext-link>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK47104/</ext-link>.</p>
        </fn> It is recommended that modifications make use of the XSLT import mechanism: write your
        modified templates in a separate stylesheet module that imports the main stylesheet module.
        The modifications can then be maintained separately in one place.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>CSS stylesheet</title>
        <p>HTML results are generated with a link to <monospace>jats-preview.css</monospace>, given
          as a relative path that expects the named file to be in the same subdirectory as the HTML
          result file (or the XML source file if it is processed directly in a browser).</p>
        <p>This can be altered at runtime by overriding the value of the <monospace>css</monospace>
          parameter supplied to the main HTML Preview stylesheet. This allows a CSS stylesheet with
          another name to be used or a stylesheet to be located elsewhere. If an empty string is
          provided, the HTML results will have no link to an external CSS.</p>
        <p>Of course, altering <monospace>jats-preview.css</monospace> or providing your own CSS
          stylesheet is an easy way to alter the look and feel of output without editing any XSLT.
          Many of the basic settings in the HTML presentation, including fonts, rules, colors
          (including the colors of warnings and generated text) may be customized in this way.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Enabling autonumbering in the XSLT</title>
        <p>As described in the <italic>Users' Guide</italic>, the Preview stylesheet does not
          generate labels with automatic numbering for elements in presentation, except the
            <monospace>fn</monospace> and <monospace>ref</monospace> elements as described there.
          However, the stylesheets are provided with variables that can be used as switches to turn
          on autonumbering, along with templates that can be modified (or overridden, in a
          customization layer) in order to control the formats of the numbers. See the stylesheets,
          especially the templates in mode <monospace>label-text</monospace>.</p>

      <title>Support of OASIS tables</title>
      <p>A conversion stylesheet is included in this distribution for converting OASIS Exchange XML
        tables, as specified in <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.oasis-open.org/specs/tm9901.html"
          >OASIS Technical Memorandum TR 9901:1999</ext-link>, into the subset of HTML tables used
        by JATS. This is in order that JATS variants using OASIS tables may also use these preview
        stylesheets; but the OASIS conversion logic will work on any data containing OASIS tables
        (in the namespace
        <monospace>http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/oasis-exchange/table</monospace>), making them into
        HTML equivalents (not namespace-qualified). As with other components of this distribution,
        developers are free to extend and modify this stylesheet and to integrate it into their
        systems.</p>
      <p>This module is designed so it can be imported into another (XSLT 2.0) stylesheet, although
        in this distribution it is presented as a separate pipeline step. (This is in order that the
        main preview stylesheets may still use XSLT 1.0, for the broadest possible support.)
        Developers familiar with the architecture of XSLT may wish to integrate it more tightly by
        calling it into another stylesheet (using <monospace>xsl:import</monospace>) instead of
        using it as a separate step.</p>
      <p>In addition, this distribution also includes a Schematron schema for use with OASIS tables,
        which must be checked against constraints over and above validity to a DTD or schema. This
        Schematron will ensure that tables are "square" (rows and columns are all filled, allowing
        for implied table cells, row and column spanning etc.), that attributes are given
        consistently, and so forth. Since some analytic operations are provided using XSLT
        stylesheet functions, this Schematron requires a processor that permits foreign elements (in
        this case, XSLT elements) to be present.</p>

      <title>Specification of "simple citation" NISO JATS 1.0</title>
      <p>Projects that wish to dispense with automated formatting of citations, to extend the
        automated processing provided, or to develop their own citation formatting logic, will need
        to know the subset of Journal Publishing 3.0 that can be reliably converted by the preview
        stylesheets. This profile introduces additional constraints on elements related to
        bibliographic citations: <monospace>element-citation</monospace>,
