of a scanning tunneling microscope the tip voltage 3 8 ev) is the key physical quantity in the cutting process after reviewing several possible physical mechanisms we conclude that the cutting process relies on the weakening of the carbon-carbon bonds through a combination of localized particle-hole excitations induced by inelastically tunneling electrons and elastic deformation due to the electric field between tip and sample the carbon network releases part of the induced mechanical stress by forming topological defects that act as nucleation centers for the formation of dislocations that dynamically propagate towards bond-breaking introduction since the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991 a lot of progress has been made in the synthesis as well as in the characterization of the electronic optical and mechanical properties of these remarkable molecules they are promising structures to use as components in submicrometer-scale devices and in nanocomposites a carbon nanotube can be visualized as a graphite sheet rolled up seamlessly into a cylinder they have diameters in the range of 0 6-30 nm and are many microns in length depending on the synthesis conditions they can appear in multi-walled or single-walled configurations the tube symmetry determines not only the electronic (metallic or semiconducting) character but also the plastic/brittle behavior the special geometry makes the nanotubes excellent candidates for mesoscopic quantum wires evidence for (1d) quantum confinement was obtained from electronic transport measurements on single-walled nanotubes the transition from one-dimensional (wire) to zero-dimensional (quantum dot) behavior can be achieved directly by cutting a long nanotube to a shorter length this has been recently done by venema et al by applying voltage pulses to the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (stm) located just above a nanotube discrete energy states consistent with a 1d particle-in-abox model have been measured with stm spectroscopy in such short tubes the possibility to control the length of nanotubes by the cutting technique is of interest for various applications of carbon nanotubes in nanoscale devices in this

locally cut by applying a voltage pulse to the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (stm) the carbon nanotubes that were studied were single-walled synthesized by a laser vaporization technique and consisted mainly of nm diameter nanotubes (material from r e smalley and coworkers) samples were prepared by depositing a dispersion of nanotubes in 1 2-dichloroethane onto single-crystal au(111) surfaces the experiments were done both at room temperature and at 4 k nanotubes are cut by the following procedure during imaging of a nanotube in constant-current mode scanning is interrupted and the stm tip moves to a selected position on the nanotube feedback is then switched off and a voltage pulse between tip and sample is applied for 1 ms after this pulse the feedback is switched on again and scanning resumes where imaging was interrupted the distance between the stm tip and the nanotube during a pulse is determined by the settings for the feedback current and voltage fig 1(b) shows an example of a nanotube that has been cut into various smaller tube pieces as a result of voltage pulses of -3 75 v applied at the positions marked in fig 1(a) often tube parts beneath the stm tip are picked up during a pulse this usually leads to degradation of the tip quality cleaning of the tip can then be done by applying voltages on the gold surface away from the nanotube [30;42m1[0m the cutting efficiency as a function of the bias voltage applied during a pulse is shown in fig 2 this experimental result provides essential input for the theoretical modeling of the cutting mechanism described below the efficiency at a specific voltage is defined as the number of successful cutting events divided by the total number of applied pulses at that voltage a large number (about 150) of voltage pulses were applied at room temperature in a range of 1 to 6 v at positive and negative polarity the pulses were applied on various nanotubes both semiconducting and metallic to study the dependence of cutting efficiency on the distance between the stm tip and the nanotube during a pulse feedback currents were varied between 20 pa and 1 na and feedback voltages between 0 1 and 3 v were used no dependence of cutting efficiency on the tunnel distance was found pulses applied with various feedback currents and voltages are therefore included in same graph of fig 2 the main experimental results are listed below [30;42miii[0m [30;42m1[0m [30;42m-molecules[0m we find a sharp threshold for the voltage of 3 8 0 2 v for cutting nanotubes this is independent of polarity below 3 6 v nanotubes could almost never be cut above 4 v tubes were almost always cut [30;42m2[0m the cutting efficiency is independent of the feedback tunnel current or voltage the tunnel resistance has been varied over three orders of magnitude which changes the tunnel distance significantly this demonstrates that the determining physical quantity for cutting is the voltage rather than the electric field [30;42m•[0m the cutting procedure appears to be effective for different types of nanotubes we observe no dependence on the electronic character (i e semiconducting or metallic) of a tube [30;42m3[0m [30;42m1 4[0m nanotubes can be cut at room temperature as well as at 4 k [30;42m•[0m nanotubes within bundles can be cut as efficiently as isolated single-wall tubes (see for an example fig 3) [30;42m•[0m upon decreasing the tunnel distance considerably by increasing the tunnel current beyond 1 na nanotubes are moved away laterally by the stm tip during imaging [30;42m•[0m the separation between nanotube ends created by a cut varies significantly in size from a few nm to 20 nm sometimes the tube ends are displaced after the cut fig 4(a) for example shows a strongly bent nanotube on which two voltage pulses were applied near the marked positions fig 4(b) shows that the three tube parts separated by the cuts were moved significantly by the cutting events most likely the nanotube was fixed on the substrate under some strain that was released by the cutting physical concepts for the cutting mechanism in this section we survey a number of possible physical mechanisms for the breaking of nanotubes by a voltage pulse that are interrelated to various degrees shear pressure simply crashing the tip into the tube could be a possible cutting mechanism however experimentally we find that the tubes are moved laterally when the tip is brought close to the tube this is related to the large reversible elastic response (flexibility) exhibited by carbon nanotubes simulations of impact on carbon nanotubes have shown that even large radial forces produce reversible elastic distortions indicating that crashing the tip onto the tube is not an efficient method to cut furthermore there is no obvious energy scale of 4 [30;42m2[0m [30;42m4[0m ev in the crashing process [30;42m•[0m crack propagation this is related to the propagation of voids and cracks already present in asgrown nanotubes under low (tensile) loads however there is no evidence from stm or otherwise for the presence of local defects or cracks in the swnt material studied here this mechanism is hence not considered to be important [30;42m•[0m collective excitations (plasmons) plasmons excited by inelastic electron scattering of the tunneling current can decay into electron-hole pairs phonons or other excitations that induce a polarization or charge separation in the tube eventually the release of the plasmon energy leads to a break through local heating and atom evaporation due to the particular cylindrical geometry of carbon nanotubes we expect to have a excitation at about 5 ev this has been confirmed experimentally for swnts of nm diameter the decay of the plasmon excitation into atom evaporation is a well-known phenomenon in metallic clusters where the surface-plasmon energy is of the order of the binding energy leading to atom-evaporation as an effective decaying mechanism of the collective excitations in the case of tubes with an internal binding energy greater than 7 ev/atom (as for most carbon solids see table i) however multiple-plasmon excitations need to be active to induce transitions which weaken the carbon bonds this puts this mechanism behind first-order models however it can enhance the probability of electronic excitations (see below) [30;42m•[0m localized particle-hole excitations this mechanism is concerned with the symmetry-allowed interband excitation of localized to states of character near the fermi level these electronic excitations leave localized behind which weaken the c-c bonds by creating possible nucleation sites for breaking of the tube electrons tunneling inelastically between tip and tube are the source for these excitations the probability for this process is favored by the local electric field at the tiptube interface which independent of the metallic or semiconducting behavior enhances the number of possible bonding/antibonding transitions triggering the bond-breaking the density of states (dos) for a (10 10) nanotube which is metallic is shown in fig 5 near the fermi level the dos is finite and constant at higher energies sharp peaks can be observed which are the van hove singularities at the subband onsets at above/below 3 6 ev from the fermi level the interband excitations involve states with a predominant character with a small curvature induced hybridization the excitations of the states have been found in nanotubes to lead to a broad spectral feature in the experimental electron-energy loss-spectra close to the excitation similar to the case of interband transitions in graphite this interband excitation involving localized introduces a natural energy threshold for the cutting process to take place around 3 6 ev this agrees quite well with the experimental observation of a sharp threshold voltage for cutting of 3 8 ev that is independent of polarity field-induced elastic deformation the large electric field from the tip apex causes significant changes in the c-c bond lengths this introduces a mechanical instability in the tube that triggers the formation of topological defects (double pentagonheptagon defect pairs see fig 6) that dynamically evolve towards breaking of the tube (see next section for details) this effect is enhanced by the stress introduced in the nanotube during the electronic excitation of localized (as discussed in the previous mechanism) the induced stress acts on the tube for the whole 1 ms applied voltage pulse which is long enough for the formation and evolution of the dislocation cores the combination of the last two processes is the most likely to constitute the basic mechanism for cutting of nanotubes the cutting process then is triggered by the inelastic electron excitations involving transitions of localized at about 3 6 ev this accounts for the threshold voltage found in the experiments the c-c bonds are further weakened by the mechanical stress induced by the large electric field between tip and [30;41msample[0m [30;42msam3[0m [30;42mple[0m these two processes together induce topological defects and drive the system to mechanical instability in the next section we present a more detailed analysis of mechanisms 4 and 5 as well as specific molecular dynamics simulations of bond rearrangement and bond-breaking driven by the stress introduced in the nanotube [30;42miv[0m the cutting mechanism in the previous section we have sorted out a possible scenario for the cutting of nanotubes by a voltage pulse this section discusses in more detail the bond weakening due to mechanisms 4 and 5 described in the previous section the formation and propagation of topological defects due to the bond weakening will also be discussed [30;42ma[0m localized electronic excitation in order to understand the role of electronic excitations in the bond-weakening and cutting process we show in fig 5 how the density of states of a (10 10) swnt is modified by an applied electric field in the direction perpendicular to the tube axis here the structural relaxation and electronic calculations were done in the framework of the ab-initio total-energy densityfunctional pseudopotential theory we find that the field tends to increase the nanotube s lattice parameter by a few % nearly independent of the polarity of the applied bias potential eventually as the field strength increases the structure can reach a state which is not in a stable equilibrium for the carbon atoms any more in the calculations shown in fig 5 the field acts on the whole tube for fixed atomic coordinates results are shown corresponding to electric fields accessible in the experimental setup (up to 1 ev/å) one could also take into account the spatial variation of the applied field related to the tip-size in that case there are distinct regions one far from the tip where the electronic properties of the tube are dictated by the isolated tube and the other just beneath the tip where the electronic properties are modified by the applied field from fig 5 we see that the applied field results in the appearance of localized levels which increases the dos in an energy region close to the fermi level (this effect is related to the bond-weakening and bond-length increase in carbon nanotubes under an applied voltage discussed above) the increase of density of states near the fermi level enhances the number of possible transitions that can take place semiconducting nanotubes have a dos comparable to that of metallic nanotubes but have an energy gap with zero dos near the fermi energy however the electric field will induce states within the gap similar to the increase of dos near the fermi level for metallic nanotubes this allows localized particle-hole excitations to take place also for semiconducting nanotubes indeed in the experiments [30;42m5[0m no difference is found in cutting efficiency between semiconducting and metallic nanotubes it may appear that any electronic mechanism should be current dependent however the number of broken bonds is far less than the number of available electrons in the cutting process the excitations become possible because of the large current available in the stm experiment the experimental range of currents during the cutting process (more than 50 na) is such that during the 1 ms pulse more than thousand electrons are involved in inelastic events this means that we are in a saturated regime where cutting can in principle be achieved independent of the current this situation can be compared to the situation of cutting si h bonds with an stm where the desorption yield was found to be independent of bias or current once the bias is large enough the formation of topological defects is a natural way of releasing the excitation energy and naturally triggers the breaking process [30;42mf[0m [30;42m(2)[0m

mechanical stress in the nanotube within a macroscopical approach an argument for using a macroscopic model is that the specific elastic constants of single wall nanotubes determined from experiments follow quite well the predictions for the macroscopic elasticity theory (in terms of the young s modulus poisson ratio and torsion and bending elastic constants )2 [30;42m[31])[0m although the ultimate description of the fracture mechanics is a complex phenomenon that requires both macroscopic and microscopic descriptions we thus rely on a continuous model to get a first estimate of the parameters involved in the process the typical energy of the distortion process is such that it corresponds to bond-breaking energies for carbon compounds (see table i) or to displacements which fulfill a lindeman melting criterion of a 10% change in bond distance we consider the tube as a thin hollow rod which is clamped to the surface by van der waals forces in the cutting process the tube is distorted by the tip in a region the size of the tip (length-scale l) for a hollow tube (inner radius and outer radius of bending inertia and young s modulus y we expect a relative deformation for an applied force f where n is a number of order 10-100 depending on details of the modeling such as force distribution and boundary conditions we estimate the force f from the interaction between a

of the tube that would reduce the force by approximately 20 % but not its dependence on and with v=4 volts a distance of d=10 å and r=100 å (a reasonable value in stm when simulating a tip with a sphere ν) we find a force of 15 nn this is independent of the polarity of [30;42mrd[0m [30;42m20å[0m the bias as found experimentally soler et al experimentally found that graphite surface would be experiencing a 1 å deformation in an stm configuration for a force of the order of 1 nn notice however that the relevant elastic constants in their case are related to the weak interlayer bonding in graphite as reflected in the corresponding and elastic contansts these are much smaller than the constant (reflecting the strong intralayer bond) which is relevant in our case (see table ii) using now eqn (1) and inserting y 1 tpa we find that for a distortion higher than the 10% lindeman criterion l has at least to be about 5 nm (of course strongly depending on n) the 10 % change in the bond lengths can lead to brittle behavior (see below) all this happens for electric field of the order of 1 v/å which are in the experimental range notice that this pull of electro-magnetic origin is happening over the length covered by the tip shape and drops dramatically outside the tip providing a highly distorted region dynamical bond-breaking now we address how the electronically and mechanically induced strain can lead to the breakdown of a tube a plausible mechanism is the stone-wales (sw) transformation leading to bond-rotation defects this comprises of a pair of pentagon-heptagon defects obtained by a simple c-c bond–rotation in the hexagonal network see fig 6 these defects are the main source of strain release for tubes under tension and determine the overall electronic character of the tube the pentagon-heptagon defect behaves as a single edge dislocation in the tube circumference once nucleated the pair dislocations can relax further by successive stonewales transformations we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of strain-induced defect and plastic/brittle behavior using the tight binding parameterization of ref that reproduces quite will density-functional calculations within the local-density-approximation the computed (t=0k) sw defect formation energy in an armchair nanotube at different applied strains shows that for a tensile strain of about 5% for a (10 10) tube and 12% for a (12 0) tube the defect geometry is energetically favourable over the perfect tube the activation barrier for the formation of defects is lowered by the applied tension indeed the activation barrier for bond rotation in a (10 10) nanotube is found to reduce from 5 6 ev at zero strain to 3 ev at 10% strain similar reduction is observed for the barrier for separation of the pentagon-heptagon dislocation cores the dynamics of these defects are dictated by the tube chirality as well as the applied tension and temperature in particular at high applied strain and low temperature all tubes are brittle in the simulations restricted to armchair tubes we observed that after the nucleation of the first sw-defect octagonal and higher order rings start to appear as the applied strain is increased this leads to brittle behavior and shows the important role of the strain induced by the applied voltage the simulation time scale for the formation and evolution of these defects are of the order of nanoseconds much shorter than the applied voltage pulse of 1 ms we thus expect the natural nucleation and evolution of these defects beneath the tip region of the stm leading to a bond breaking and possible local collapse of the structure [30;42mv[0m conclusions and outlook from the previous discussion we conclude that the applied voltage at the stm tip creates (i) excitation of localized states (ii) a change in the density of states around the fermi level making the tubes more metallic-like and (iii) an overall distortion of the region beneath the tip leading to the formation and evolution of strain-induced topological defects these processes together are responsible for the cutting mechanism with the threshold voltage of v the proposed mechanism relies only on the applied voltage it appears that within the experimental values the tip-tube distance does not change the results it would be interesting to attempt the cutting in multiwalled carbon nanotubes also the cutting will probably not work for these nanotubes since the inner layers are able to accomodate the stress acting on the outer layers furthermore we expect the inter-tube van der waals interaction in multi-walled nanotubes to be strong enough to partially release the concentration of elastic strain so that only atoms of the outer surface will be affected this is different to the case of nanotubes in bundles where the cutting process is as effective as for isolated nanotubes (see fig 3) in this case the other tubes in the bundle act as a global support similar to the gold substrate for the isolated swnts it may be interesting to see if the breaking process is accompanied by photon emission to any significant degree to gain further information about the energetic of the possible processes photon emission provides a signal that is dependent on the local physical environment beneath the tip with a spatial resolution determined by the size of the local creening charge (colective mode) involved in the photon emission typical resolution can [30;42m√[0m be estimated as using our length scales introduced above a related topic would be field emission from nano-tubes to summarize we have characterized in detail the possible mechanisms responsible for the breaking up of tubes as found experimentally
