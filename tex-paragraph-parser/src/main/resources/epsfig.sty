%%% psfig merged with EPSF = epsfig Release 1
%%% 1.0 November 91
%%% 1.1 Dec 91  fixed some bugs
%%% 1.2 Jan 92  fixed bug that it never stopped reading PS file until
%%%             it reached the end! merged in changes from psfig1.8
%%%             (plain TeX definition of \fbox, new code for rotation)
%%% 1.3 Jan 92  separated out \special code so that dvitops can be
%%%             supported. use \psfigdriver{dvitops}%
%%% 1.4 Jan 92  fixed dvitops. need to input psfig at different point
%%%      in dvips from dvitops. define \psfig@start and \psfig@end to cope
%%%      with this
%%% 1.5 Jan 92  force use of psfig method if using dvitops
%%% 1.6 May 92 fixed bugs
%%% 1.7 Sep 92 added support for emtex, sort of. reads a .bb file
%%%            and imports .pcx file. Boolean flag \epsfigdos used
%%%             to indicate that we cannot have more than one . in the
%%%             suffix (ie we will look at file.bb not file.eps.bb)
%%%
%%% 1.8 Sep 92 added support for OzTeX; fixed bugs in dvips support
%%% (including clipping to bounding box); removed use of dimen100.
%%%
%%% 1.9 Dec 92 cleaned up documentation again
%%% 1.10 Mar 93 cleaned up for plain TeX
%%% 1.11 Mar 93 merged in changes by Peter Galko (supplied by CERN) for
%%%             use with Textures
%%% 1.12 Apr 93 actually *tested* the Textures additions, and so rewrote
%%%            from scratch (borrowed an idea from psbox)
%%% 1.13 May 93 allow for file names with _ or $ in them in \psdraft, and
%%%             fix problem that occurred with missing BoundingBox
%%% 1.14 May 93 allow for .z suffix
%%% 1.15 July 93 allow for .gz suffix
%%%              use \leavevmode as appropriate
%%%              fix plain \TeX mode 
%%%             (fixes from Peter-Klaus Schilling <R02SCH@DSYIBM.DESY.DE>)
%%% 1.16 August 93 [peta@mcrcim.mcgill.edu (Peter Whaite)]
%%%        -- Implement Perl scripts to do compressed file inclusion and bb
%%%           generation. 
%%%        -- Add \pscompress.
%%%        -- Tidy up comments.
%%% 1.17 September 93 SPQR
%%%     better code for literal name printing
%%%     allowed for spaces around , and =
%%% 1.18 17.9.93
%%%   updates to epsbb and epsfig from Peter W
%%% 1.19 14.11.93
%%%   mistaken placement of calculation of EPS@Height resulted in errors
%%% 1.20 defaults to no compression
%--------------------------------------------------------
%%%
%%% code rearranged by Sebastian Rahtz (spqr@uk.ac.york.minster)
%%% from work by
%%% Trevor Darrell; Tom Rokicki; Daniel Smith; H. Payne, Robert Russell
%%%
%%% This is a version of Darrell's `psfig' macros which are designed
%%% to be used with dvips or dvitops, and the `epsf' macros (these are
%%% automaticaly included by the style file). I did this because the
%%% \special commands used by `epsf' appear to be more robust and
%%% portable than the raw \specials used by `psfig', but I preferred
%%% the psfig interface. This system preserves the psfig interface,
%%% but mainly uses epsf macros to carry out the job. The user
%%% interface is identical to \psfig, but you just use \epsfig
%%% instead. Rotation uses the original psfig macros: I could not work
%%% out how to do rotation with the epsf macros.
%%%
%%% The same applies to `rheight' and `rwidth'
%%%
%%% If you *really* want old psfig behaviour regardless, use \psfig. It is
%%% still there. Some of the features have gone, however. \figurepath
%%% seemed redundant, since it could be controlled by the TEXINPUTS
%%% variable anyway.
%%%
%%% As an added feature, if FILE cannot be found, a file called FILE.bb
%%% is searched for. This should simply contain a %%BoundingBox line. A perl
%%% script "epsbb" is provided to generate these automatically.  It is
%%% assumed that if this exists, then the actual postscript is in UNIX
%%% compress format in FILE.Z or in GNU gzip format in FILE.gz or FILE.z.
%%%
%%% The macros then read the BB from FILE.bb, but insert "`epsfig FILE`" in
%%% the  output for dvips to interpret (don't worry, it knows about this).
%%% "Epsfig" is another perl script which  searches the TEXINPUTS path for
%%% FILE or FILE.{gz,z,Z}.
%%%
%%% As an added bonus if you say \pscompress the -c switch will be passed to
%%% epsfig, causing automatic FILE.bb generation and compression the first
%%% time dvips is run.  Files in the system directories will NOT be
%%% compressed.
%%% If you are *not* on a Unix system and use this, deliberately or by
%%% mischance, you will have problems!
%%%
%%% This file can be included in a dumped format, or used as a LaTeX
%%% style file, or used in plain TeX. It does not load itself twice (I hope)

%%% More modifications by J. Daniel Smith on 29 March 1991 to allow the

%
% \psdraft      draws an outline box, but doesn't include the figure
%               in the DVI file.  Useful for previewing.
%
% \psfull       includes the figure in the DVI file (default).
%
% \psscalefirst width= or height= specifies the size of the figure
%               before rotation.
% \psrotatefirst (default) width= or height= specifies the size of the
%                figure after rotation.  Asymetric figures will
%                appear to shrink.
%
% usage: \epsfig{file=, figure=, height=, width=,
%                       bbllx=, bblly=, bburx=, bbury=,
%                       rheight=, rwidth=, clip=, angle=, silent=}%
%
%       "file" is the filename.  If no path name is specified and the
%               file is not found in the current directory,
%               it will be looked for in directory \psfigurepath.
%       "figure" is a synonym for "file".
%       By default, the width and height of the figure are taken from
%               the BoundingBox of the figure.
%       If "width" is specified, the figure is scaled so that it has
%               the specified width.  Its height changes proportionately.
%       If "height" is specified, the figure is scaled so that it has
%               the specified height.  Its width changes proportionately.
%       If both "width" and "height" are specified, the figure is scaled
%               anamorphically.
%       "bbllx", "bblly", "bburx", and "bbury" control the PostScript
%               BoundingBox.
%       "rheight" and "rwidth" are the reserved height and width
%               of the figure, i.e., how big TeX actually thinks
%               the figure is.  They default to "width" and "height".
%       The "clip" option ensures that no portion of the figure will
%               appear outside its BoundingBox.  "clip=" is a switch and
%               takes no value, but the `=' must be present.
%       The "angle" option specifies the angle of rotation (degrees, ccw).
%       The "silent" option makes \psfig work silently.
