\def\@tightleading{1.1}
\def\@doubleleading{1.6}

% Double-space by default.  Observe that you double-space in LaTeX by
% resetting \baselinestretch, which is essentially a scale factor for
% \baselineskip (= leading, for you typographophiles).  The style uses
% the \@doubleleading factor, defined above.

\def\baselinestretch{\@doubleleading}

% The \tighten command merely resets the \baselinestretch to a
% smaller factor, resulting in single-column text that is more closely
% spaced.  (This will always work.)  Tightening the vertical spacing
% in the text results in output that is more attractive for distribution
% to colleagues who are primarily interested in reading the paper, as
% opposed to copy editing it.  Double-spaced output for referees and
% copy editors is, however, the main objective of this style, hence
% double-spacing occurs by default.  The same effect as \tighten
% can be achieved by using the "tighten" document style option.

% controlled here.  It is `\relax' by default (mixed case heads), and can
% easily be changed to `\uppercase' if desired.  If mixed case headings
% are wanted by the editor, authors MUST supply mixed case text, although
% this is what authors should be doing anyway.  (Mixed can be converted
% to upper, but the reverse transformation cannot be automated.)

% Title and author identification is by way of standard LaTeX commands
% \title and \author, although the macros themselves are rather different.
% The information is typeset by these macros in this style, rather than
% being buffered as per regular LaTeX.  The authors' principal affiliation
% is specified with a separate macro \affil.  Each \author command should
% be followed by its own \affil (or address).
%
% Authors often have affiliations above and beyond their main employer,
% and these are specified with the \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext commands.
% These commands behave like the \footnotemark and \footnotetext commands
% of LaTeX.  \altaffilmark is appended to author's names in the \author
% lists, and generates the superscript identification numbers.
% The text for the individual alternate affiliations is generated by the
% \altaffiltext command.  It is up to the author to make sure that the

% alternate affiliation.

% must supply the correct punctuation according to the journal style.
%
% Note that the editors of A&A, ApJ, and MNRAS have discussed the issue
% of keywords, and there is disagreement about whether "subject headings"
% or "keywords" should appear after abstracts in astronomical papers.
% It does not really matter what the macro is called, so I will stick

% It might be possible to handle keywords and their punctuation more

% Adjust section heading typography slightly.  The manuscript editors

% will be a "." trailing the section number.  This requires hacking below
% the normal LaTeX programming interface (\@startsection), since the

%
% Also, modify the indentation behavior so that ALL paragraphs, including
% those first after section heads, are indented.  This is consonant with

% Bibliography/references environment.  For the time being, I don't think
% it would be a good idea to force an implementation based on BibTeX,
% although I'll prepare for that eventuality by using the constructs and
% general ideas of the LaTeX thebibliography environment.  Adjustments
% have been made so that the \cite-\bibitem mechanism can be used to cite
% references symbolically while maintaining proper citation syntax within
% the paper; the author must create the citation label for each reference
% in proper journal format in the \bibitem command.
%
%    \begin{thebibliography}{}
%    \bibitem[LABEL]{TEXTTAG} \reference <bibliographic data>
%    \end{thebibliography}
%
% where LABEL must adhere to the journal's standards, e.g. "Abt 1986".
%
% It is not necessary to use the thebibliography environment.  This style
% defines a references environment that simply sets off the list of references
% and adjusts spacing parameters.  It is not possible to use \bibitems
% within the references environment.  (The \reference command cannot be
% shortened to \ref; \ref is used in vanilla LaTeX for cross-referencing.)
%
%    \begin{references}
%    \reference <bibliographic data>
%    \end{references}
%
%    \markcite{TEXT}
%
% Observe that the bibliographic data supplied by the author must also
% conform to the standards of the journal.  I have elected not to burden
% authors with tedious LaTeX commands which would require many curly braces
% to delimit the bibliographic fields because many of the journals I have
% targeted in this project have agreed to reduce typographic overhead (bolding,
% italicizing, etc.) in reference lists.  (See Abt's editorial in ApJ 357.)
% It is the responsibility of the author to get these fields in the proper
% order with the correct punctuation; the information will be typeset as is,
% i.e., in roman with no size or style changes.
%
% Macros are provided for many of the oft-referenced journals so that authors
% may use the LaTeX names rather than having to look up a particular journal's
% specific abbreviation.  In principle, all the journals should be using the
% same abbreviations, too, but I anticipate some changes in the specific
% abbreviations before a set is finally settled on.  As long as these macros
% are kept up to date, authors need not be concerned about such editorial
% changes.
%
% Corresponding with the non-BibTeX references environment and \reference
% command for the reference list is the \markcite command.  This can be
% used to identify in-text citations; in this case, the author provides
% the actual citation text as opposed to the symbolic tag.  The use of
% this is encouraged, even for journals where no special formatting of
% citation call-outs is required; it is crucial for the future use of
% on-line browsers.

%  *         TABLES AND FIGURES           *
%  ****************************************

% Additions and adjustments for tables and figures.

% Footnotes for tables are to be identified with lower case alphabetics,
% rather than numeric.  \tablenotemark and \tablenotetext commands are
% provided analogous to \footnotemark and \footnotetext, but with the
% identifier *required*, like \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext.  The
% \tablenotetext must be specified before the \end{table}, since
% \end{table} displays it.
%
%     \tablenotemark{TAG LETTER(S)}
%     \tablenotetext{ALPHA TAG}{TEXT}
%
% Note that TAG LETTER == ALPHA TAG for corresponding text.  It is the
% responsibility of the author to get the correspondence correct.
%
% The table footnotes are coupled to the table in which they occur, rather
% than being associated with a particular page, and they are printed with
% the table (relatively close to the caption) instead of appearing at the
% extreme bottom of the page.  This is done to ensure that the notes wind
% up on the same page as the table, since tables are floats and can migrate
% from one page to another.  There is the additional benefit that the notes
% are unambiguously attached to the proper table, which is what is required
% in the event that the editorial requirement of one table only per page
% is ever changed to permit several tables per page.
%
% Footnotes are NOT supported for figures.

\def\tablenotemark#1{\rlap{$^{\rm #1}$}}

% The \tablenotetext command buffers the table note text and the "proper"
% tablenote formatting information in a token buffer.  The tablenotes are
% dispensed into the vertical page list by \spew@tblnotes, which is
% executed by \end{table}.  Note that certain "global" tablenote formatting
% details are handled by \spew@tblnotes, which also clears the tblnote list.
% Praise and honor are due to Kresten Krab Thorup (krab@iesd.auc.dk) for
% posting ftn.sty to the Usenet, from which I drew the technique.

% Plano tables are camera-ready pages that are included in a typeset
% article the same way as line drawings, graphs, and other camera-ready

% for a formatter to have that are somewhat above and beyond LaTeX'x
% tabular environment that would facilitate the creation of such tables.
% Among these are breaking long tables across pages, using footnotes
% in a table, specifying comments and references for tables, etc.
%
% What follows was inspired by supertab.sty by Theo Jurriens, 1988.

% Commands for identifying table elements in a consistent way.  Observe
