Quarks and glueballs

In current opinion the quark-gluon picture [\cite=Fri] well describes strong interactions. According to this picture the mesons are built out of quark (q) and antiquark ([formula]) which are coupled by gluon (g) exchange. It is supposed that this model of interaction describes mesons having any signature JPC and lying in any mass region. This property of description we call universality of the quark-gluon picture. The hypothetic g is quark-less, flavor-less electrically neutral particle. It has property of self-interaction which implies the existence of bound states of two or more gluons. Such an object is called glueball (G) and is a singlet state of SU(3) symmetry. G has similar properties as the q singlet state and can interfere with this singlet as well as with octet isoscalar states, forming in this way new SU(3) isoscalar states.

Essential property of G is that it is not observed as a separate particle. To be observable it must interact with other hadrons. For this to be the case it should have ability to mix with larger unitary multiplet. Being mixed with nonet of q states it forms a decuplet [\cite=MT]. Then it is subjected to restrictions of unitary symmetry SU(3) on decuplet components [\cite=Where]. G can be detected as one of the three interfering unphysical components creating the physical isoscalar states of decuplet [\cite=Loc]. If it dominates one of these states then it is considered as the "glueball candidate". Hence, identification of the G is possible on the ground of unitary symmetry.

The unitary symmetry is perceptible due to property of mesons to form multiplets which are collections of particles having different but definite flavors and the same signature JPC. They form octets, nonets and decuplets. Each multiplet belongs to some representation of unitary symmetry SU(3). The SU(3) multiplets are analogical to the SU(2) multiplets describing properties of electromagnetic interaction. But there is an important difference. In the SU(2) multiplets differences between masses are usually neglected. Therefore, this symmetry is considered exact. In the strong interactions the multiplets gather the particles having a priori different masses. We call them multiplets of broken SU(3) symmetry. It is believed that the breaking announces interaction.

The most apparent effect of breaking SU(3) symmetry is the difference between isotriplet and isodublet meson masses of the particles belonging to the same unitary multiplet, (e.g. π and K mesons). This breaking is described by Gell-Mann - Okubo (GMO) mass formula for the octet states. The GMO formula is universal.

Other breakings are much weaker and are masked by GMO one. They can be exhibited if description of the multiplet comply with GMO requirement. Such a multiplet is named the multiplet of flavor symmetry. The effect of its breaking is described as anomaly. As GMO breaking is universal the anomalies can be observed in all multiplets larger than octet. Anomalies of flavor symmetry are very interesting as they comprise information about the interactions which we want to investigate.

Anomaly of flavor SU(3) can be observed as the anomaly of multiplet mass pattern. It also can be seen due to pattern difference of two (or more) identical multiplets differing only in JPC signatures or belonging to various mass regions. The anomalies provide information on interaction breaking of the SU(3) symmetry.

We now consider the problem of how to recognize anomalies. In the next two paragraphs we remind how the multiplets are described and define the standard multiplet which provides pattern for anomalies search.

VEC multiplets of mesons

The flavor SU(3) multiplets are described by the model of vanishing exotic commutators (VEC). The model introduces a system of master equations (ME) describing the light meson flavor multiplets [\cite=Where]

[formula]

where r is power index. Symbols of particle xi, a, K stand for the mass squared of physical mesons,

[formula]

where the coefficients li express the octet contents of isoscalar states xi

[formula]

where li are real numbers as x8 and xi describe uncharged states. Hence,

[formula]

and index i runs over all isoscalar mesons of the multiplet. Numbering of the isoscalar mesons is chosen so that i increases with growing mass:

[formula]

The ME are linear with respect to unknown coefficients l2i. Solution defines wave function of the flavor multiplet provided the conditions ([\ref=D]) are satisfied.

The octet, nonet and decuplet are described by the solution of ME for the multiplets n = 1, n = 2 and n = 3, respectively. The octet masses a and b make the basic input of ME ([\ref=A]). There exists only one multiplet which is determined by this input. For other multiplets this input is insufficient. The VEC description guarantees that all flavor multiplets comply with GMO breaking.

The number of ME depends on the multiplet. The minimal number is n, the maximal one is greater by the number of independent mass formulae (MF). This reflects the fact that, apart from the coefficients l2i, the system ME determines also the MFs of the multiplet [\cite=Loc].

For n = 1; r = 0, r = 1 ME are reduced to the GMO mass formula and define the octet. GMO allows for equal masses of particles belonging to the octet. The octet describes 4+  + mesons:

[formula]

and possibly some of the higher lying vector 1-  - mesons [\cite=Sum]

Ideal nonet as a pattern

For n = 2 ME describe the nonets. The VEC model reveals some of their properties which were not discussed before. VEC distinguishes three kinds of nonets [\cite=Loc]:

Gell-Mann - Okubo (GMO nonet) having no MF,

Schwinger (S nonet) having one MF,

Ideal (I nonet) having two MF.

The I nonet is described by the solution of the following system of ME: Solving the first two equations we calculate l21, l22 as the functions of masses. Next, substituting the l2i's into third and fourth equations we obtain two MFs which determine the masses of mesons x1, x2. The solution of ME which describes the I nonet can be given in the form

[formula]

where N and S are isoscalar states of the ideal nonet.

This solution is an effect of GMO restriction individually acting on SU(3) nonet states. As the GMO breaking mechanism is universal the solution ([\ref=G]) is also universal. The I nonet is the only meson multiplet having this property; other nonets as well as decuplets are subjected to more complicated breaking. Simplicity of this solution and its explicit connection with GMO-breaking mechanism makes I nonet a pattern enabling exhibition of the nonet anomalies by comparison.

The possibility of confronting properties of different multiplets arise from the fact that they are described by the same VEC model.

S nonets or D1 decuplets ?

S nonet is the most frequently appearing multiplet of the light mesons. It is observed for several JPC mesons in various mass regions [\cite=RPP].

The S nonet has one MF. To get the solution for l2i (i = 1,2) of ME we need an extra condition enabling us to evaluate x1, x2. We can use experimental value of one of the masses and calculate the second one with the help of MF. But the pair of isoscalar meson masses determined in this way differs from the ideal masses ([\ref=G]) resulting from single GMO-breaking of SU(3). The change of S-nonet masses x1, x2 toward the I-nonet ones discloses the existence of an extra breaking of the already GMO-broken SU(3) nonet. That, in turn, suggests the existence of interaction between the I nonet and some unknown particle which causes their mixing and creates a decuplet.

VEC predicts two kinds of decuplets: D0 which has no MF and D1 complying with one MF [\cite=Loc]. The situation sketched above is described by D1 which is defined by the system of ME: The solution determines l2i (i = 1,2,3) which define decuplet wave function if the conditions ([\ref=D]) are satisfied. Then the solution defines also the MF of the decuplet

[formula]

The nature of an extra particle whose mixing with the I nonet creates the decuplet is undetermined. VEC only requires that an extra particle extending I nonet to D1 decuplet should be an SU(3) singlet; it accepts all extending singlets which are usually mentioned, like G, hybrid or multi-quark. Then it would be possible that each D1 arises due to mixing with some specific extending singlet and can have individual properties.

Our purpose is the opposite. We look for such extending singlet which creates decuplet as universal structure and at the same time describes most of the flavor decuplets. Among extending singlets mentioned above only the G is supposed to have the property of universality. Therefore, we use this name everywhere.

The masses of the D1 decuplet satisfy the mass ordering rule (MOR) [formula]

[formula]

MOR divides accessible region of the xi meson appearance into three separate subregions which are delimited by a and b. The states in each subregion are uniformly dominated by N, G, S:

[formula]

Therefore, we may introduce more transparent notation

[formula]

where

[formula]

are basic states of the decuplet isoscalars. Changing indexes one can express MOR ([\ref=Ja]) in more transparent form

[formula]

where xa, xG, xb are dominated by N, G, S respectively. This notation is convenient for comparing the properties of the S nonet states with the D1 ones.

Let us confront S nonet and D1 decuplet descriptions. S nonet may be considered as deficient D1 decuplet built on the same basis of octet states a and b. MOR restrictions on the S nonet are known for a long time [\cite=Sum] [\cite=Where] [\cite=Loc]. Applying decuplet notation of N, G, S-dominated states to nonet isoscalar states xi we present the nonet MOR restrictions as

[formula]

These relations tell us that G is included in all S nonets. This suggests its essential role in creating nonets and decuplets. Probably, within these multiplets the suitable G is always "ready to use" since it is built of the gluons mediating the interaction between quarks included in the multiplet. This way G becomes one of the constituents of the isoscalar mesons. Remind that 4+  + mesons forming octet include neither scalar q state nor G one.

Observe that the nonet description does not explain the origin of S nonet anomalies. Moreover, the nonets are distinguished by results of biased experiments ignoring possibility of decuplet appearing. Perhaps, results of these measurements should be reanalyzed.

The D1 description looks more reliable. In such a case the nature of G could be probably interpreted in the spirit of Van der Waals-like interaction.

Unrecognised glueballs and missing mesons

Let us continue the comments. The comparison of the S nonet MOR ([\ref=M]a, [\ref=M]b) with D1 MOR ([\ref=L]) shows that N, G, S - dominated nonet isoscalar states xi are in both multiplets similarly restricted and occupy the same positions in relation to a and b bounds.

Looking over particle data [\cite=RPP] we find that the mesons

[formula]

should be G-dominated. The decay modes of f1(1285) and h1(1380) do not contradict these assignments; the G dominated structure of η(1405) meson established earlier [\cite=Where] is now confirmed; the f2(1430) should have G dominated structure if it exists [\cite=Loc].

If it is really the case the nature of these mesons have been for a long time notoriously misunderstood. Revealing this misunderstanding must have far-reaching implications to meson spectroscopy. Some of the implications can be seen immediately.

As all S nonets include G-dominated xG state, it follows that in each of the nonets N-dominated xa or S-dominated xb state is missing. These two omissions reflect two different anomalies of the S nonets. These nonets describe sets of different particles and implications of anomalies are different. The axial-vector mesons 1+  + and 1+  - provide good illustration of such situation.

One of the implications concerns determination of the mass of axial-vector 1+  + meson a1(1260). As S nonet MOR does not include the xa state ([\ref=M]a) the N-dominated state is not represented in this S nonet. D1 description requires in this region two particles: one isoscalar and one isovector. This suggests that observed very wide bump of this meson [\cite=RPP]

[formula]

should be attributed to two states:

[formula]

Observe that missing isoscalar state xa is N-dominated and its structure is similar to structures of the a1 mesons. This leads to the problem of their separation.

Among the 1+  - mesons only the isoscalar h1(1170) and isovector b1(1235) ones have known masses. These masses suggest that S nonet of these mesons obeys MOR ([\ref=M]b). According to the decuplet MOR ([\ref=L]) the other mesons should satisfy the relations

[formula]

Missing one of these particles as well as poor knowledge of remaining particles masses do not allow for other conclusions. Although signals from G dominated and S dominated mesons should be located on opposite sides of b it may be difficult to distinguish them. The attribution of xG properties to h1(1380) is symbolic.

Call for new data

Anomalies of the S nonets provide the evidence for the existence of further (beyond GMO) mechanisms of SU(3) breaking. The anomalies are caused by interactions which are unknown. To recognize their nature is just a purpose of the S nonet investigation. The anomalies provide much weaker breaking than the GMO one. This requires much more accurate data to make them observable. The present data (partly old and skimpy) enable completing few nonets but generally are insufficient for completing decuplets. Therefore, in the interest of present and future development of meson spectroscopy it is necessary to increase accuracy of the data and extend the measurements to other JPC mesons.
