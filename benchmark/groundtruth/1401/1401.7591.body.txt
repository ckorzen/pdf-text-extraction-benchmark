for the Food-Selection Problem

Where can I have dinner tonight?

What is the typical Roman cuisine that I should (not) miss?

Where can I find the best coffee or gelato in town?

Introduction

Eating is one of life's greatest pleasures, especially in Rome. Thus, the general advice recommends foreigners to be adventurous and to follow the well-known maxim:

When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

Unfortunately, previous experimental evidence suggests that this approach may not even lead to a feasible solution in finite time because of convergence problems. Indeed, there is an incredible variety of eateries, especially in districts such as Testaccio, Trastevere, Campo de' Fiori, Piazza Navona, or the Ghetto. The problem of selecting a good restaurant seems therefore of practical importance in this mouth-watering scenario.

In this paper we present the experimental evaluation of the algorithms for the food selection problem originally presented in [\cite=pigout]. These algorithms are based on fundamental algorithmic techniques including random sampling, divide et impera (sorry guys, but we are in Rome!), local search, hill climbing, and the greedy approach, and require only constant time. However, given that every month is high season for tourism in Rome, if you don't plan in advance you may be forced to use backtracking (the restaurant may be full or closed): this occurrence could increase considerably your running time.

Local Search

Well, it's VIII PM and SEA sessions are over. You feel so hungry that even power-law graphs look like fettuccine. Local search seems the appropriate technique to apply in this case. Like any good Roman district, you will not be spared by the wealth of great restaurants, trattorias and pizzerias around the SEA venue. We enumerate now all the solutions we found using a simple local search algorithm. All the solutions can be easily reached on foot (in XV minutes or so, depending on hunger pangs) even if you don't like walking or if you are not very good at computing shortest paths: see Figure [\ref=fi:localsearch].

Hill Climbing

Hill climbing appears to be a very promising approach: to understand why, let's review a little bit of history on the VII Hills of Rome. Tradition says that Rome was founded in DCCLIII (753) BC by twin boys, Romulus and Remus. Romulus and Remus were abandoned by their parents, put in a cradle and sent off to be drowned on the Tiber river. The boys were found by a she-wolf who took care of them as if they were her own cubs. (We remark that all of this happened well before Mowgli appeared.) When the boys grew a bit older, a shepherd found them: he and his wife raised them to be young men. At that point, the twins set out on a quest: on their way they found a beautiful land with seven hills, which they named Palatine (Palatino), Aventine (Aventino), Capitoline (Campidoglio), Quirinal (Quirinale), Viminal (Viminale), Esquiline (Esquilino) and Caelian (Celio). They were very excited: but, who would rule that piece of land? To determine this, Romulus stood on the Aventine hill and Remus stood on the Palatine: whichever hill the birds flew over, that brother would rule the land. It was said to be a message from the gods. After a long time, six birds flew over the Palatine hill where Remus was standing, and so he thought he would rule, until twelve birds flew over the Aventine hill where Romulus stood, and Romulus ended up ruling Rome.

Nowadays, the seven hills, the valleys in between, and some other hills such as Janiculum (Gianicolo, rising above Trastevere) and Pincian (Pincio, rising above Piazza del Popolo) represent just the central part of the city (Centro Storico), in which you will find the main monuments, archeology sites, wonderful views, museums, and fine restaurants. But don't be scared about climbing Rome's hills: they aren't that big after all! Some restaurants and trattorias in central Rome are listed below.

... or you can drink a coffee at the following cafes (but please, remember, you are not supposed to order a cappuccino in Italy after noon!):

Caffè Sant'Eustachio, Centro Storico - Pantheon, Piazza Sant'Eustachio 82, one of the best places to taste real Arabian Coffee. Try the caffè speciale, granita, irish cream, or parfait (B2)

Ciampini, Centro Storico - Campo Marzio, via della Fontanella di Borghese 59 / Piazza San Lorenzo in Lucina 29 (B2)

Divide et Impera (Divide and Conquer)

Well, you know that Rome wasn't built in a day, and when the input size gets large, divide et impera can yield good results. To apply the technique, divide the map of Rome into IX squares having approximately the same area, as shown in Figure [\ref=fi:mappa-large]. Based on your taste and preferences, choose an area where you would like to have dinner (e.g., area B2) and find the corresponding entry in the lookup table given in Figure [\ref=tab:geometriclookup]. Scan the list of restaurants of Section [\ref=se:hill-climbing], discarding those not located in any of the areas listed in the selected lookup table entry. Choose a restaurant among the remaining ones: if the list of remaining restaurants is empty (don't panic: this is a low probability event), return "Error # MCCLXXIX: Diet suggested."

Random Sampling

If you choose a restaurant uniformly at random from the lists given in Section [\ref=se:localsearch] and in Section [\ref=se:hill-climbing], you can still expect a reasonably good solution.

The Greedy Approach

If you want to try authentic Roman cuisine, look for the following dishes when you order (especially in traditional restaurants such as "trattorie" and "osterie"). A short guide can be probably helpful in order to get oriented:

And now, these are for the really adventurous people:

Among other Italian foods that are worth trying, we also recommend:

Experimental Evaluation of Pizzas in Rome

In Figure [\ref=fi:pizza] we report the results of our experiments on the thickness of the pizzas we tried in Rome. We refer only to the pizzas made in specialized restaurants, called pizzeria, where the pizza is served in dishes and it has the traditional round shape. On the other hand there are many take-away shops called pizza a taglio, where the pizza is prepared in long, rectangular baking pans. It is important to mention that the pizza in pizzerie is mostly cooked in a wood-fired oven, while in pizza a taglio shops they usually cook it in an electric oven. As we can see from the plot, more than 70% of the pizzas is less than one centimeter thick, and the remaining is much taller. It is interesting to notice that almost no intermediate thickness value has been found in our experiments. This confirms that in Italy there are two different kind of pizzas: the romana (roman) one and the napoletana (neapolitan). Here we summarize our main findings:

The pizza romana, besides being thinner, has a crispy base. On the opposite side, the pizza napoletana has soft and pliable bases.

In Rome the pizza toped with tomato, mozzarella, anchovies, and oil is called Pizza Napoletana. In Naples the same pizza is addressed as Pizza Romana. Surprisingly, there is no Pizza Romana in Rome and no Pizza Napoletana in Naples!

If you are from outside Italy and you like the "pepperoni pizza," don't ask for the "pizza con i peperoni"--that is, pizza with peppers! The proper name is "Diavola."

Drinking Wine

There is some experimental evidence that drinking alcoholic beverages during conference sessions can improve the appreciation of the talks (see also the related Ballmer Peak shown in Figure [\ref=fi:xkcd]): results vary significantly whether the speaker, the audience or both are drinking (in a famous talk from FUN 2004 conference both the speakers and a large portion of the audience were drinking beer, that was distributed by the speakers (authors) that explained it by saying: "we were drinking beer when we wrote this paper, and we think you should drink beer too when you listen to this talk").

We don't have enough space here to discuss this issue but, if you plan to taste wine during SEA, we suggest the following list of enoteche and wine bars in Rome:

Trimani, Via Cernaia, 37, ph: 06-4469630 (C1). This is probably the most famous roman enoteca, whose roots date back to 1821. Here they only sell wine, but there is also Trimani Il Wine Bar, Via Cernaia, 37, ph: 06-4469630, where you can taste wine and eat (C1)

Ai tre scalini, via Panisperna, 251, ph: 06-48907495. Please note that this place, besides being there since 1895, it is in the street that gives his name to the famous Via Panisperna boys, the group of young scientist led by Enrico Fermi, that in 1934 discovered the slow neutrons (B1)

Cavour 313, Via Cavour, 313, ph: 06-6785496‎. It has a very large selection (C2)

Gusto, Piazza Augusto Imperatore, 9, ph: 06-3226273. It has also a restaurant and a kitchen good store (A2)

Il pentagrappolo, Via Celimontana, 21b, ph: 06-7096301. This is a wine music bar (C3)

Cul de Sac, Piazza di Pasquino, 73, 06-68801094. This is another very famous place in Rome (A2)

If you prefer to drink beer, you can not miss the Beer House, Via Merulana 109 (it is very close to the SEA venue - R7 in Figure [\ref=fi:localsearch]). Here, besides many types of beers, you can enjoy the traditional home made roman cuisine that is well defined by the sign just above the door: cucina mi madre that, in roman slang, means "my mother is the chef" (but we know that there is always something lost in translation). They have also free WiFi.

We conclude by suggesting the nice (and very little!):

Caffè letterario Aquisgrana, via Ariosto 28-30

that is very close to the SEA conference venue (few meters away): here you can taste not only wine, but also many beers and some traditional medieval alcoholic beverages: sidro, idromele and ippocrasso! The last one, ippocrasso, is hand made by Simona and Patrizia, the owners of this place that offers also a small selection of books as well as handbound notebooks. And there is free WiFi!

Eating SEAfood during SEA

If you want to experiment SEAfood during the SEA conference, we provide a small list of restaurant below; however, if you also want to look at the SEA while eating SEAfood during the SEA conference, i.e., the full experience, the recommended venue is Fiumicino, the small city on the coast near to Rome, close to the airport that bears its name.

Baia Chia, Via Machiavelli, 5, ph 06-70453452. Very close to the conference venue.

Mater Matuta, Via Milano, 47, ph: 06-4823962. Also in walking distance from the conference venue.

Su Nuraghe, Via Imperia, 66, ph: 06-44291846. It will serve you more food than you can eat!

Ragno d'Oro, Via Silla, 26, ph: 06-3212362. Small, remember to book before you go!

Rosetta, Rosetta, 8, ph: 06-6861002. Very very very expensive. Don't say we didn't warn you!

Concluding Remarks and Open Problems

We think that our experimental results should provide a good insight to the problem addressed so far. However, more experiments are needed for various related problems. For example, when a large group is at the end of a nice dinner, and a cake is served, what is the right strategy? This problem has been addressed in [\cite=cake1] [\cite=cake2], but we strongly believe that is missing an experimental validation of the theoretical results presented in the above papers. We hope that SEA participants will contribute in this direction. According to our experimental study done by the authors, the tested algorithms appear to achieve very good approximation ratios: the typical outcome of the experiments is exemplified in Figure [\ref=fi:albertone].

And to conclude, Horatius would say:

Nunc est bibendum,

nunc pede libero pulsanda tellus

"Now it is the time to drink, now it is the time for the loose feet to hit the floor" (Horatius, Carmina 1, 37).

Appendix I

Wanna know the real story behind Fettuccine Alfredo? In MCMXIV (1914) a small restaurateur living above his small Rome restaurant was faced with a problem no respectable Roman could endure: the loss of his wife's appetite. Many months pregnant, Alfredo di Lelio's wife refused all her husband's best dishes. Watching his wife grow weaker, Alfredo made a vow: "I'll invent something so tasty that she will immediately succumb to temptation," remembers Russell Bellanca, co-owner of the U.S. branches of Alfredo the Original of Rome. So late one night in his tiny kitchen, Alfredo dropped a handful of fresh fettuccine egg noodles into a pot of boiling water. He melted butter and Parmegiano Reggiano cheese, and then he mixed in the pasta. Fettuccine Alfredo was born! His wife cleaned her plate, and a short time later, Alfredo II was born to the music of customers downstairs in Alfredo's I's restaurant, all crying for his new irresistible dish. Today, of course, the original Alfredo's in Rome, which is in Piazza Augusto Imperatore, is lorded over by Alfredo the III. Amazingly enough, nowadays fettuccine Alfredo are more known in the U.S. than in Rome: there are branches of Alfredo's in Manhattan and Miami Beach, as well as in Disney World's Epcot Center.
