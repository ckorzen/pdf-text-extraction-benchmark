Optical properties of a disordered metallic film: local vs. collective phenomena

Introduction

Disordered systems of a various physical nature with different typical lengthscales play an important role in condensed matter physics. Among the systems with a disordered atomic configuration we find various alloys, amorphous semiconductors and diluted magnetics. Disordering at a nanoscale level is typical for arrays of semiconductor quantum dots and metallic heterostructures. Depending on the lengthscale, the disorder reveals itself in different experimental observables. For systems with an atomic length scale disorder, the electronic properties are the most interesting. For random arrays of nanometer-size and larger particles, the study of their optical response is a remarkably active field of research.

There is a number of common approaches to describe the different phenomena in disordered systems. In particular, the approach of the coherent potential approximation (CPA) has been used for the description of the electronic system in the substitutional alloy model [\cite=Soven:1967], but it has also been applied in the description of the optical properties of disordered nanostructures. Nevertheless, there is a considerable difference in the type of the interaction (short-range hopping for electrons and long-range Coulomb interaction in the optics of nanostructures). One should also note that optics offers much larger set of observables; for example, the generation of high optical harmonics allows experimentalists to study many-particle Green's functions of photons. For a theoretician working in the field of electronic structure, a description of the optical response provides an additional possibility to validate existing calculation schemes and it can be a good playground for the development of new methods.

In this paper we consider a model describing disordered films of metallic particles. The optical properties of small metal particles in a dielectric host have already been investigated for a very long time. Inhomogeneity is common for these materials - the shape, size and positions of inclusions in the matrix can be distributed in a random way. There exists a sizable number of models and theories devoted to the calculation of the optical response of such metal-dielectric composites. Nowadays, the problem of theoretically describing and calculating the optical properties of such systems have gained interest because of progress in the technology of preparing novel materials [\cite=Heilmann.mono]. The possibilities of modern technology to fabricate samples with well controlled parameters allow to perform an accurate experimental verification of theories in this field.

The solution to the problem of light scattering by a single spherical particle in a host material was provided by Mie in the beginning of the 20th century [\cite=Mie:1908]. Metal particles exhibit a well-known Mie resonance, corresponding to excitation of the collective mode of the conduction electrons. For ensembles of metal spheres, the Mie resonance peak is broadened and shifted due to the electromagnetic interaction of particles and disorder effects. In the three dimensional case, these effects lead to certain spectral behavior corresponding to an effective dielectric constant of the inhomogeneus medium. This result can be achieved by the so-called mixing approximations, the most well-known were developed by Bruggeman [\cite=Bruggeman:1935] and by Maxwell Garnett [\cite=Garnett:1904]. In Bruggeman's method, all constituents of the composite, including the host material, are considered as spherical inclusions in a homogeneous effective medium. The Maxwell Garnet theory (MGT) considers the effective medium for the inclusions, but not for the matrix material. In both approaches the dielectric constant of the effective medium is obtained self-consistently. Through a number of more sophisticated effective-medium approaches, the CPA can be shown to be the best local theory, as it accounts of all local diagrams. For the planar systems such as metal island films, the effective dielectric constant makes little sense. However, the concept of an effective medium is still fruitful, and methods of the CPA family are widely accepted.

A particular case of a system where the CPA is easy to formulate is the case of a periodic lattice with metallic particles randomly placed at nodes [\cite=Persson:1983] (the so-called lattice gas). The CPA corresponds to a substitution of the partially filled lattice with a regular one, having particles with a self-consistent permittivity at each node [\cite=Persson:1983], [\cite=Persson:1983a], [\cite=Barrera:1991]. Physically this means that fluctuations of electromagnetic field at different sites are assumed as uncorrelated (that is, fluctuations are local). Usually, the Drude model is used for the frequency dependence of the permittivity of the particles, and a dipole-dipole interaction between the particles is assumed.

There are a few arguments for physics beyond the single-site CPA. Firstly, in some systems there are correlations due to grouping of the disordered particles. For example, a fractal nature of clusters is assumed in a series of works [\cite=Hui:1986], [\cite=Chang:1992], [\cite=Markel:1996], [\cite=Markel:2004]. The idea that in a set of randomly distributed particles some specific configurations of particles placed close to each other gives a significant contribution to the total polarizability is applied in [\cite=Kochergin:2007]. Another case are systems in which the particles are distributed independently, but spatial correlations appear in the electromagnetic field at different particles. This is particularly the case for systems with a high filling factor, whereas the concept of local correlations is more suitable for low filling factors.

For the description of non-local field correlations, there are strong insights from the theory of electronic structure in the Anderson model with δ-correlated disorder, since the mathematical formulations of both problems almost coincide. While the CPA was successfully used in a number of calculations for the electronic properties of metallic alloys ab initio, certain peculiarities in the electronic density of states are attributed to non-local correlations. A trivial generalization of the single-site CPA is to introduce a "supercell" containing several atoms, and to suppose that correlations are located in such a real-space cluster. However, such an approach clearly violates the translational invariance of the lattice and it also does not provide a significant improvement to single-site theory [\cite=Tsukada:1972], [\cite=Ducastelle:1974]. It is much better to formulate a theory operating in quasimomentum space, as is done in the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA). Roughly, in the DCA the Brillouin zone is divided to several parts, and the self-energy is supposed to be [formula]-independent within each of these parts. Self-consistent calculations for certain clusters are used to estimate the self-energy; the number of atoms in the cluster equals the number of parts of the Brillouin zone. If this number is equal to one, the method passes into the CPA. Originally the DCA was developed for ordered correlated electronic systems (such as the Hubbard model) to include non-local corrections to the dynamical mean-field approximation [\cite=Jarrell:2000]. The idea of the DCA was modified and applied to the Anderson model of disordered systems[\cite=Jarrell:2001], and it is known as the non-local coherent potential approximation (NLCPA). It is shown that this method can be reformulated as a unique reciprocal-space theory of disorder[\cite=Rowlands:2008].

Numerical simulations of the optical properties of disordered metal films were also performed, and the results of these simulations are useful to test our theoretical investigation, because of the possibility to test the systems with defined parameters. Using Monte-Carlo computer simulations, the dielectric properties of hard spheres of point-like dipoles fluids are investigated and deviation from the Clausius-Mossotti-Lorenz-Lorentz (CMLL) formula is investigated in [\cite=Cichocki:1989], and the value of the correction parameter [\cite=kirkwood:592] has been calculated. For the same type of system with different concentrations the effective susceptibility is calculated in the work [\cite=Kumar:1989], the results are compared with the results of the MGT approach. In [\cite=Cuiker:1990] a Monte-Carlo method is applied for the calculation of the response of disordered lattice systems. A spectral approach for the calculation of the susceptibility of the two-components composites is used in [\cite=Bergman:1979].

Apart from the remarkable progress in theoretical methods as well as in experimental techniques, a relatively small number of theoretical predictions have been quantitatively compared with experimental data so far. This is because of the difficulty in preparing a well-controlled sample exactly corresponding to the system under theoretical consideration (a lattice gas, for instance). On the other hand, the significant increase of computing power in the last few decades makes it possible to undertake direct numerical simulations of such systems. This allows to check the validity of theories in the most direct way. Such calculations are one of the subjects of this paper.

Another, and more important point is the calculation based on the so-called dual variables approach (DVA), that provides a regular diagrammatic series constructed on top of the CPA. This method was originally introduced for classical lattice ensembles [\cite=Rubtsov:2002] and correlated fermions [\cite=Rubtsov:2008], as an extension of the effective-medium approximations. Recently, the DVA have been successfully applied for the Anderson localization problem [\cite=Terletska:2012] for disordered systems. It is worth to note that in all mentioned papers an introduction of dual variables is based on Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation in the expression for the partition function. For the Anderson localization problem, replica method was also utilized. In the present paper we show that for disordered system, at least at the basic level, neither the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation nor replica method are not nessesary for the construction of the DVA. The change of variables, and further construction of the diagram series can be done directly in the expression for the linear response of the system.

To highlight the effects of long-range correlations, we perform a simulation of a lattice gas with dipole-dipole interaction and compare the numarical data with results of the CPA, NLCPA, and the DVA.

In the "Definitions", we describe details of the system under consideration and discuss methods used for study of the response function of those systems. In the next three subsections, we outline the CPA, NLCPA and the dual-variables approach, respectively. The "Calculations" section is devoted to computational details, and in the "Results" we compare the numerical simulations and analytical calculations described above.

Definitions

We consider the optical response of a planar film containing spherical metallic particles. The size of particles and the lattice constant are assumed negligible in comparison with the wavelength of the incident radiation. Also for simplicity, we consider only the case of the electrical field being normal to the film plane. The general case can be considered similarly [\cite=Persson:1983]. Particles are placed at the nodes of a regular square lattice (arbitrary lattice symmetry could be assumed), but their susceptibilities are random uncorrelated quantities. In the dipole approximation, this system is described by the system of equations for the dipole moments di:

[formula]

where αi are (random) susceptibilities of the particles, and Cij describes their dipole-dipole interaction. Since we stick to the Rayleigh limit, [formula] (Kronecker δ is included to exclude a self-action). Note that in the optical problems susceptibility has a finite imaginary part, wheras in problem of the electrons localization assume an infinitesimal displacment of poles from the real axis. In this paper, we are interested in the average value of the dipole moment, 〈d〉. Using the ergodic hypothesis one can equally average over the sites of an infinite system or over the realizations. A distribution function of the susceptibility α should be specified. We assume a binary distribution, so that αi takes the value α+ with a probability p, and α- with a probability (1 - p). There is an important special case of α-  =  0, which corresponds to a partially filled lattice (lattice gas) with a filling factor p. It also should be pointed that α has a spectral dependence α  =  α(ω), where ω is the frequency of the incident field.

The equations ([\ref=dipole-regular-lattice]) can be represented in a matrix form:

[formula]

In real-space, the matrix α is diagonal, with random uncorrelated elements. The regular matrix C becomes diagonal after the Fourier transform. The solution of ([\ref=vec-dipole-regular-lattice]) after averaging over system configurations gives the average dipole moment of the whole system and can be represented as follows:

[formula]

where G is the response function. The later is diagonal in quasimomemtum space (k-space), due to the translational invariance of the averaged system. Mention here that [formula] function represents the average dipole moment of the whole system, wheras [formula] determines the density of state (DOS) of the system. Such phenomena as localization, optical scattering and high harmonic generation are determinded by higher order Green's functions. For a weak disorder the standard diagrammatic expansion is valid, in general case a more sophisticated consideration is needed.

The effective-medium concept

The most trivial effective-medium approach to calculation of the response of a disordered system is to replace all the dipole moments with an average value, so that ([\ref=dipole-regular-lattice]) become:

[formula]

For the system under consideration this approach is the so-called virtual crystal approximation (VCA).

The Fourier-transform gives the solution in reciprocal space [formula] with

[formula]

One can observe that such a mean-field approximation corresponds to neglecting the correlations between the susceptibility of a particle and the acting field; mathematically this is the decoupling [formula]. Strictly speaking, this is not true even for a single fluctuating site placed in a regular medium. Indeed, the dipole moment results in a polarization of the medium, and that polarization contributes to the field acting on the site. This is similar to the effect of the so-called electrostatic image, that acts on a dipole placed near a substrate. The larger the dipole moment is, the larger the image field becomes. So, the susceptibility and the field become correlated, and the mean-field decoupling breaks down.

Such "trivial" correlations are completely taken into account within the CPA. In this approximation, a hybridized single-site problem is considered, so that instead of [formula] one calculates the average:

[formula]

where δ represents the regular self-influence of the node due to the environment (bath). The average response is now given by the Green's function

[formula]

As a last step of the CPA formulation, one requires that the single-site average ([\ref=CPAimp]) mimics the local part of the lattice Green's function,

[formula]

This equation allows to find self-consistently the hybridization A.

The non-local CPA

The natural way to further develop an effective medium theory, is the construction of a self-consistent scheme, which takes into account non-local correlations, using the self-consistency condition for a set of sites (cluster). The main disadvantage of such methods is the violation of the translational invariance of the underlaying lattice as a result of the embedding of a real-space cluster into the medium. In the NCLPA self-consistent clusters with the periodical boundary conditions are constructed in the reciprocal space, and the effective medium in this method preserves the translational invariance of the initial lattice. It is constructive to represent the NLCPA effective medium in coordinate space not as a set of site clusters, but as a set of interacting sublattices. In the reciprocal space this is equivalent to dividing the Brillouin zone of the initial lattice into Nc tiles. In contrast with the single site approximation for the self-energy in the CPA, the exact self-energy in the NLCPA is approximated as a step function with the number of steps in reciprocal space, corresponding to the number of considered sub-lattices:

[formula]

This assumption accounts for the non-local correlations described by off-diagonal elements of the self-energy only for sites located on different sublattices.

The next approximation made in the NLCPA is setting the phase factors in the Fourier transformation to unity for all [formula]. Physically this means that each site of the cluster interacts with the medium irrespective of its position in cluster.

The corresponding Green's function is represented by coarse-grained propagators [formula] ([formula] is taken from the set of [formula]):

[formula]

where the [formula] - summations run over the momenta of the n-th cell, N is the number of nodes in the lattice, and Nc is the number of tiles. The explicit representation of the coarse-grained Green function in reciprocal space has a standard form:

[formula]

It is necessary to introduce the cluster-excluded propagator (also called the cavity Green's function) [formula] to avoid the occurrence of a cluster self-action:

[formula]

The self-consistent scheme in this approach is based on a requirement that the coarse-grained Green function equals the Green's function for the cluster placed in a corresponding cavity:

[formula]

where the average is taken over the cluster configurations. In a practical calculation, the righ-hand side of the expression ([\ref=GF-NLCPA]) is calculated in the real space, with a subsequent Fouirer transform. For a small cluste and a binary distribution of αi, the cluster Green's function can be found analytically. Formulas ([\ref=CG-GF-NLCPA]-[\ref=GF-NLCPA]) form a closed set of the NLCPA equations.

To show similarity between the CPA and the NLCPA, one can rewrite ([\ref=GF-NLCPA]) as follows:

[formula]

where [formula] In this notation ([\ref=CG-GF-NLCPA]) appears to be an extension of ([\ref=CPA-SCC]):

[formula]

Clearly, the NLCPA passes into the CPA for Nc  =  1. In the limit of Nc  →  N the results of the NLCPA become exact.

The CPA contribution to the self-energy part consists of only the members corresponding to scattering at a single node, and consequently the self-energy is [formula]-independent: [formula]. Because of the assumption about the approximation for the exact self-energy, the NLCPA takes into account (in an approximate way) non-local correlations at the lenghtscale comparable with a cluster size.

Dual variables approach

We start the discussion of the dual variables method by formally introducing the following expression:

[formula]

where Δ is a diagonal, regular matrix. Inversion of this matrix and subsequent averaging gives M- 1  =  (C + Δ)(α- 1 - C)- 1(C + Δ) + (C + Δ), so that instead of eq. ([\ref=GF-def]) one can calculate [formula]:

[formula]

We may assume that [formula] can be represented as an expansion:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Diagrammatic techniques can be used for representation and further work with this expansion. By construction, we require that

[formula]

at each order of the expansion (self-consistent condition). This condition in diagrammatic form reads (Fig. [\ref=fig:Diag]a), where the solid line represents the dual propagator, and dashed line is corresponds to influence of the disorder.

In reciprocal space this requirement is represented as follows:

[formula]

At the zeroth order of the expansion ([\ref=M-exp]) [formula] and since Y  ≠  0, it immediately follows from ([\ref=SCC-RS]) that:

[formula]

It is clear that later is the same as the self-consistent condition of the CPA ([\ref=CPA-SCC]). In other words, the zeroth order of this approach is the single-site self-consistent effective medium approach, equal to the CPA.

One can observe that the theory is indeed very similar to the dual-fermion approach [\cite=Rubtsov:2008]: formulas ([\ref=GGdual]) and ([\ref=SCC-DVA]) are the same as corresponding expression for the dual fermions, although Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation was not used in the presented approach for a disordered system.

Let us now consider the leading-order correction to the CPA, as it appers from the expansion ([\ref=M-exp]). As long as [formula], all odd members of this expansion vanish. The second term of the ([\ref=M-exp]) is also equal to zero, since we require ([\ref=SCC-DVA]) by construction of the method. It now follows that the next non-vanishing term of the ([\ref=M-exp]) is of fourth order in Y. We can use standard techniques to achieve the following representation of this approximation in the form of the Dyson equation:

[formula]

where [formula] stands for [formula], and represents the Green function in dual variables; Σ̃ is the dual self-energy part. The diagrammatic representation of this equation has the usual form shown on Fig. [\ref=fig:Diag]c, where [formula] is depicted as the double line. The self-energy part Σ̃, by the assumption above has the next form (Fig. [\ref=fig:Diag]b).

It is worth to mention that the CPA could be represented as diagrammatic equal of the double line to the solid one.

Taking into account the self-consistent condition ([\ref=SCC-DVA]), we can obtain an explicit form of the Green's function in reciprocal space:

[formula]

where Δ is found using an iteration procedure.

Calculations

For the model under consideration we have performed calculations of the response function using different methods, described above. Results of the numerical simulations are used as reference to compare with the results of our analytical approaches.

Numerical simulations were performed for the square lattice formed by [formula] nodes with periodic boundary conditions. The average response function is calculated by averaging the response functions for a set of random system configurations. For each system configuration the response function is calculated directly. This leads to the series of multiple inversion of the matrices with corresponding dimension N2, the typical number of realizations is [formula]. The response function for different system parameters can be calculated independently, and it is natural to perform these calculations in a parallel way. Taking into account that at each realization of the system only the diagonal elements of the corresponding matrix are changing, a special algorithm can be used for the inversion of this set of matrices. This algorithm allows to efficiently vectorize computations and perform the calculations using the GPGPU (general-purpose computing on graphics processing unit).

Calculations are organized as follows: the regular part of the matrix is inverted on the CPU using a standard numerical alghoritm, then, for each system realization the diagonal matrix elements are changed consequently, and the inversion of the matrix is performed on the GPU, using relation (based on the Sherman-Morrison formula):

[formula]

where G'ij is inverted from matrix Mij with l-th diagonal element changed to M'll  =  Mll  +  δM. This algorithm allows to perform calculations up to 70-times faster than corresponding computations on the single CPU.

We calculate the dependence of the response function on the inverse single-particle susceptibility for systems with different filling fractions, and compared it with analytical results. We apply the idea of the NLCPA for the system under consideration with the Brillouin zone divided into Nc = 4 tiles (([formula]) - tiling). For systems with different filling fractions we performed calculations of the dependence of the response function on the inverse susceptibility of a single particle, and performed comparison with analytical results. Since the susceptibility of a single particle is frequency dependent, these dependencies can be discussed as spectral dependencies. Let us discuss the results of analytical approaches applied to the system under consideration.

Results

For presentation purposes, it is better to switch from the susceptibility α to a frequency argument. We suppose [formula] with a small loss factor γ.

Thus created spectral dependence of the density of states (that is, local part of [formula]) is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:DOS] for different filling factors. One can observe that the qualitative behavior of the curves is complex. The numerical data shows a central resonant peak and two satellites, and a broadening of the entire curve with an increase of the filling factor. As it follows from the CPA curves, the local single-particle physics is responsible for the broadening effects and the overall shape of the curve, whereas the satellite structure is completely missed in the CPA and must be therefore attributed to non-local effects. The displacement of the satellites from the central peak is almost independent of the filling factor. It is natural to conclude from this observation that the satellites appear because of certain short-range effects, like a formation of resonant dimers of two particles placed at neighboring nodes. Indeed, long-range collective effects involving a large number of particles would be strongly dependent on the concentration.

As it was described above, cluster methods and dual variables provide complimentary approaches to the problem of non-locality. The NLCPA describes the short-range effects related to resonances due to some local configurations (for example, the formation of a resonant dimer of two neighboring particles, as discussed). Those effects are treated unperturabtively: an infinite number diagrams is virtually summed up. Contrary, the DVA allows to take into account both short- and long-range correlations on equal footing, but only within a certain perturbation procedure (in our case, just taking into account the leading-order diagram). From this argumentation one should expect that the satellite structure is better described with the NLCPA, and indeed, our calculations confirm this. Similarly to the previous results for the Anderson model the NLCPA curves do show the satellites, although their positions do not always coincide with the numerical data. On the other hand, the DVA completely misses this effect.

Now let us turn to the results for the [formula]-dependent spectral function [formula] near the resonance of the density of states. Figure [\ref=fig:Gk] shows the data exactly on the resonance and at a point on the shoulder of the curve (pointed by arrows in Fig. [\ref=fig:DOS]). Our numerical data demonstrates a strong change of the dispersion law, that is not accurately captured by the CPA. Besides a quantitative disagreement, at the main resonance of the density of states one can observe a qualitative difference: the numerical data along (π,π)  -  (π,0) line at border of the BZ show a much flatter spectral function than the CPA predicts. This flattening can be interpreted as an effect of a strong disorder. It occurs for certain region of the quasimomentum values and is consequently a non-local effect.

For the [formula]-dependence of the spectral function, one cannot expect a good result from the NLCPA, because the ([formula]) - tiling is too crude to describe an actual [formula]-dependence, and a step-like change at the borders of tiles is unphysical. Indeed, one can discuss only the slope of the NLCPA curves in Fig. [\ref=fig:Gk], the detailed behavior is not reproduced. It is also hard to speculate about a reproduction of the flattening phenomenon.

Contrary, the DVA describes short- and long-range phenomena at the same footing, and thus produces smooth [formula]-dependencies. It also describes the observed flattening phenomenon, demonstrating a behavior qualitatively very similar to the numerical data. We conclude that the DVA handles the physics of the strong disorder near the DOS peak energy.

We should remark that such a picture is not generic for all points of the spectral curve. For instance, one should not expect a good result from the DVA at the satellite points, as the formation of the satellites itself is not handled by the DVA. Indeed, as Fig. [\ref=fig:DOS] shows, neither the NLCPA nor the DVA are satisfactory in this respect. In fact, the best fit of the numerical data is given by just the CPA.

More progress can be expected with use of combined schemes, including both cluster and dual-variables contributions. We made an effort to implement the simplest scheme of this kind. We substituted the short-ranged part of the self-energy calculated in the CPA by the corresponding part of the NLCPA self-energy. Results of this method are shown in figures by the curves marked as NCLPA+DVA, and it is seen that this scheme doesn't works satisfactory: no significant improvment is found; the curve shows kinks and a wrong behavior at the shoulders. A more advanced combined method is clearly needed.

We conclude that the dual-variables approach provides a powerfull framework for systems with a diagonal disorder. It is more suitable for the description of a long-range spatial correlations, whereas a short-range physics is better captured by the NLCPA (cluster) methods.
