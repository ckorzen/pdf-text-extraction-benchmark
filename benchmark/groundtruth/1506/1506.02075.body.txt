Large-scale Simple Question Answering with Memory Networks

Introduction

Open-domain Question Answering (QA) systems aim at providing the exact answer(s) to questions formulated in natural language, without restriction of domain. While there is a long history of QA systems that search for textual documents or on the Web and extract answers from them (see e.g. [\cite=voorhees2000overview] [\cite=dumais2002web]), recent progress has been made with the release of large Knowledge Bases (KBs) such as Freebase, which contain consolidated knowledge stored as atomic facts, and extracted from different sources, such as free text, tables in webpages or collaborative input. Existing approaches for QA from KBs use learnable components to either transform the question into a structured KB query [\cite=berant-EtAl:2013:EMNLP] or learn to embed questions and facts in a low dimensional vector space and retrieve the answer by computing similarities in this embedding space [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014]. However, while most recent efforts have focused on designing systems with higher reasoning capabilities, that could jointly retrieve and use multiple facts to answer, the simpler problem of answering questions that refer to a single fact of the KB, which we call Simple Question Answering in this paper, is still far from solved.

Hence, existing benchmarks are small; they mostly cover the head of the distributions of facts, and are restricted in their question types and their syntactic and lexical variations. As such, it is still unknown how much the existing systems perform outside the range of the specific question templates of a few, small benchmark datasets, and it is also unknown whether learning on a single dataset transfers well on other ones, and whether such systems can learn from different training sources, which we believe is necessary to capture the whole range of possible questions.

Besides, the actual need for reasoning, i.e. constructing the answer from more than a single fact from the KB, depends on the actual structure of the KB. As we shall see, for instance, a simple preprocessing of Freebase tremendously increases the coverage of simple QA in terms of possible questions that can be answered with a single fact, including list questions that expect more than a single answer. In fact, the task of simple QA itself might already cover a wide range of practical usages, if the KB is properly organized.

This paper presents two contributions. First, as an effort to study the coverage of existing systems and the possibility to train jointly on different data sources via multitasking, we collected the first large-scale dataset of questions and answers based on a KB, called SimpleQuestions. This dataset, which is presented in Section [\ref=sec:fbq], contains more than 100k questions written by human annotators and associated to Freebase facts, while the largest existing benchmark, WebQuestions, contains less than 6k questions created automatically using the Google suggest API.

Second, in sections [\ref=sec:memnn] and [\ref=sec:training], we present an embedding-based QA system developed under the framework of Memory Networks (MemNNs) [\cite=weston2014memory] [\cite=sukhbaatar2015weakly]. Memory Networks are learning systems centered around a memory component that can be read and written to, with a particular focus on cases where the relationship between the input and response languages (here natural language) and the storage language (here, the facts from KBs) is performed by embedding all of them in the same vector space. The setting of the simple QA corresponds to the elementary operation of performing a single lookup in the memory. While our model bares similarity with previous embedding models for QA [\cite=bordes2014open] [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014], using the framework of MemNNs opens the perspective to more involved inference schemes in future work, since MemNNs were shown to perform well on complex reasoning toy QA tasks [\cite=weston2014memory]. We discuss related work in Section [\ref=sec:related].

We report experimental results in Section [\ref=sec:expes], where we show that our model achieves excellent results on the benchmark WebQuestions. We also show that it can learn from two different QA datasets to improve its performance on both. We also present the first successful application of transfer learning for QA. Using the Reverb KB and QA datasets, we show that Reverb facts can be added to the memory and used to answer without retraining, and that MemNNs achieve better results than some systems designed on this dataset.

Memory Networks [\cite=weston2014memory] - or MemNNs - are a new class of models that combine neural networks with a memory component that can be read and written to. They have been primarily designed for question answering (QA): given a question, they answer by first querying their memory to retrieve relevant supporting facts and then using those facts to formulate a response. Their training process teach them how to use their memory for answering. Existing implementations [\cite=weston2014memory] [\cite=weston2015towards] [\cite=sukhbaatar2015weakly] have shown that MemNNs are able to learn to perform complex reasoning on various tasks and with various degrees of supervision, making them a very promising method for eventually understanding language at scale.

However, most results involving MemNNs so far have been obtained on synthetic datasets. Those have multiple advantages, especially in the way that one can clearly control their difficulty, which make them very interesting test beds for learning machines. However, they are not grounded in real situations or real human motivations and do not use real language, which tend to limitate the impact of the nice results of MemNNs. Hence, MemNNs are currently facing three main challenges to be able to eventually scale up to understanding of language. They should be able to:

handle more complex reasoning patterns;

operate on data in real natural language;

use a very large memory designed to encode background and common-sense knowledge.

This paper studies the last two points through the task of Simple QA. We define Simple QA as the task of finding the correct answer to any question in natural language in a Knowledge Base (KB) when the reasoning process is basic and only requires to retrieve and use a single supporting fact to answer correctly. Despite simple, this problem can be large-scale since answering a question might require to search over a memory of millions of entries. It can also allow to answer a lot of different questions. More specifically, we consider two main questions regarding MemNNs for simple QA:

How should the memory be structured to allow a feast and reliable retrieval of supporting facts?

How can we train MemNNs in this context where the supervision is weak and incomplete? Can we fruitfully learn from multiple sources?

We show that:

MemNNs can reach state-of-the-art with no prior knowledge, just KB + lexicon

MemNNS are robust to the addition of new facts to their memory, coming from another KB. They can also answer using them, without having to be retrained.

KB must be highly connected to perform best: (i) remove mediator nodes to speed up inference and increase connectivity (ii) group facts to reduce search space (iii) increase KB size to have even more connections

The more training sources are provided the better the system becomes, with especially a much better coverage in terms of questions that can be answered.

We introduce a new data for simple QA, SimpleQuestions.

Interestingly, our conclusions 3., 4. and 5. do not concern only MemNNs but any QA system and should then benefit to many.

Simple Question Answering

Knowledge Bases contain facts expressed as triples , where and are entities and describes the type of (directed) link between these entities. The simple QA problem we address here consist in finding the answer to questions that can be rephrased as queries of the form , asking for all objects linked to by . The question What do Jamaican people speak ?, for instance, could be rephrased as the Freebase query . In other words, fetching a single fact from a KB is sufficient to answer correctly.

The term simple QA refers to the simplicity of the reasoning process needed to answer questions, since it involves a single fact. However, this does not mean that the QA problem is easy per se, since retrieving this single supporting fact can be very challenging as it involves to search over millions of alternatives given a query expressed in natural language. Table [\ref=tab:ex] shows that, with a KB with many types of relationships like Freebase, the range of questions that can be answered with a single fact is already very broad. Besides, as we shall see, modiying slightly the structure of the KB can make some QA problems simpler by adding direct connections between entities and hence allow to bypass the need for more complex reasoning.

Knowledge Bases

We use the KB Freebase as the basis of our QA system, our source of facts and answers. All Freebase entities and relationships are typed and the lexicon for types and relationships is closed. Freebase data is collaboratively collected and curated, to ensure a high reliability of the facts. Each entity has an internal identifier and a set of strings that are usually used to refer to that entity in text, termed aliases. We consider two extracts of Freebase, whose statistics are given in Table [\ref=tab:kbs]. FB2M, which was used in [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014], contains about 2M entities and 5k relationships. FB5M, is much larger with about 5M entities and more than 7.5k relationships.

We also use the KB Reverb as a secondary source of facts to study how well a model trained to answer questions using Freebase facts could be used to answer using Reverb's as well, without being trained on Reverb data. This is a pure setting of transfer learning. Reverb is interesting for this experiment because it differs a lot from Freebase. Its data was extracted automatically from text with minimal human intervention and is highly unstructured: entities are unique strings and the lexicon for relationships is open. This leads to many more relationships, but entities with multiple references are not deduplicated, ambiguous referents are not resolved, and the reliability of the stored facts is much lower than in Freebase. We used the full extraction from [\cite=ReVerb2011], which contains 2M entities and 600k relationships.

The SimpleQuestions dataset

Existing resources for QA such as WebQuestions [\cite=berant-EtAl:2013:EMNLP] are rather small (few thousands questions) and hence do not provide a very thorough coverage of the variety of questions that could be answered using a KB like Freebase, even in the context of simple QA. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a new dataset of much larger scale for the task of simple QA called SimpleQuestions. This dataset consists of a total of 108,442 questions written in natural language by human English-speaking annotators each paired with a corresponding fact from FB2M that provides the answer and explains it. We randomly shuffle these questions and use 70% of them (75910) as training set, 10% as validation set (10845), and the remaining 20% as test set. Examples of questions and facts are given in Table [\ref=tab:ex].

We collected SimpleQuestions in two phases. The first phase consisted of shortlisting the set of facts from Freebase to be annotated with questions. We used FB2M as background KB and removed all facts with undefined relationship type i.e. containing the word . We also removed all facts for which the (subject, relationship) pair had more than a threshold number of objects. This filtering step is crucial to remove facts which would result in trivial uninformative questions, such as, Name a person who is an actor?. The threshold was set to 10.

In the second phase, these selected facts were sampled and delivered to human annotators to generate questions from them. For the sampling, each fact was associated with a probability which defined as a function of its relationship frequency in the KB: to favor variability, facts with relationship appearing more frequently were given lower probabilities. For each sampled facts, annotators were shown the facts along with hyperlinks to to provide some context while framing the question. Given this information, annotators were asked to phrase a question involving the subject and the relationship of the fact, with the answer being the object. The annotators were explicitly instructed to phrase the question differently as much as possible, if they encounter multiple facts with similar relationship. They were also given the option of skipping facts if they wish to do so. This was very important to avoid the annotators to write a boiler plate questions when they had no background knowledge about some facts.

Memory Networks for Simple QA

A Memory Network consists of a memory (an indexed array of objects) and a neural network that is trained to query it given some inputs (usually questions). It has four components: Input map (I), Generalization (G), Output map (O) and Response (R) which we detail below. follows:

an input feature map step that converts inputs into the internal feature representation. In our case, I preprocesses KB facts to add them to the memory and questions to prepare them for answering.

a generalization step that updates the memory given the new input. We use this step when new facts are added to the memory after the training phase so that they can be readily used to answer new questions, without having to retrain the whole model.

an output feature map step that produces new outputs given an input and the memory. In our case, this is the main answering stage that fetch the relevant fact from the memory given a question.

a response step that converts the output into the response format desired; it actually returns the answer(s) for us.

But first, we describe the MemNNs workflow used to set up a model for simple QA. This proceeds in three steps:

1. Storing Freebase:

this first phase parses Freebase (either FB2M or FB5M depending on the setting) and stores it in memory. It uses the Input module to preprocess the data.

2. Training:

this second phase trains the MemNN to answer question. This uses Input, Output and Response modules, the training concerns mainly the parameters of the embedding model at the core of the Output module.

3. Connecting Reverb:

this third phase adds new facts coming from Reverb to the memory. This is done after training to test the ability of MemNNs to handle new facts without having to be re-trained. It uses the Input module to preprocess Reverb facts and the Generalization module to connect them to the facts already stored.

After these three stages, the MemNN is ready to answer any question by running the I, O and R modules in turn. We now detail the implementation of the four modules.

Input module

This module preprocesses the three types of data that are input to the network: Freebase facts that are used to populate the memory, questions that the system need to answer, and Reverb facts that we use, in a second phase, to extend the memory.

Preprocessing Freebase

The Freebase data is initially stored as atomic facts involving single entities as subject and object, plus a relationship between them. However, this storage needs to be adapted to the QA task in two aspects.

First, in order to answer list questions, which expect more than one answer, we redefine a fact as being a triple containing a subject, a relationship, and the set of all objects linked to the subject by the relationship. This grouping process transforms atomic facts into grouped facts, which we simply refer to as facts in the following. Table [\ref=tab:kbs] shows the impact of this grouping: on FB2M, this decreases the number of facts from 14M to 11M and, on FB5M, from 22M to 12M.

Second, the underlying structure of Freebase is a hypergraph, in which more than two entities can be linked. For instance dates can be linked together with two entities to specify the time period over which the link was valid. The underlying triple storage involves mediator nodes for each such fact, effectively making entities linked through paths of length 2, instead of 1. To obtain direct links between entities in such cases, we created a single fact for these facts by removing the intermediate node and using the second relationship as the relationship for the new condensed fact. This step reduces the need for searching the answer outside the immediate neighborhood of the subject referred to in the question, widely increasing the scope of the simple QA task on Freebase. On WebQuestions, a benchmark not primarily designed for simple QA, removing mediator nodes allows to jump from around 65% to 86% of questions that can be answered with a single fact.

Preprocessing Freebase facts

A fact with k objects y  =  (s,r,{o1,...,ok}) is represented by a bag-of-symbol vector f(y) in [formula], where NS is the number of entities and relationships. Each dimension of f(y) corresponds to a relationship or an entity (independent of whether it appears as subject or object). The entries of the subject and of the relationship have value 1, and the entries of the objects are set to 1 / k. All other entries are 0.

Preprocessing questions

A question q is mapped to a bag-of-ngrams representation g(q) of dimension [formula] where NV is the size of the vocabulary. The vocabulary contains all individual words that appear in the questions of our datasets, together with the aliases of Freebase entities, each alias being a single n-gram. The entries of g(q) that correspond to words and n-grams of q are equal to 1, all other ones are set to 0.

Preprocessing Reverb facts

In our experiments with Reverb, each fact y  =  (s,r,o) is represented as a vector [formula]. This vector is a bag-of-symbol for the subject s and the object o, and a bag-of-words for the relationship r. The exact composition of h is provided by the Generalization module, which we describe now.

Generalization module

This module is responsible for adding new elements to the memory. In our case, the memory has a multigraph structure where each node is a Freebase entity and labeled arcs in the multigraph are Freebase relationships: after their preprocessing, all Freebase facts are stored using this structure.

We also consider the case where new facts, with a different structure (i.e. new kinds of relationship), are provided to the MemNNs by using Reverb. In this case, the generalization module is then used to connect Reverb facts to the Freebase-based memory structure, in order to make them usable and searchable by the MemNN.

To link the subject and the object of a Reverb fact to Freebase entities, we use precomputed entity links [\cite=lin2012entity]. If such links do not give any result for an entity, we search for Freebase entities with at least one alias that matches the Reverb entity string. These two processes allowed to match 17% of Reverb entities to Freebase ones. The remainder of entities were encoded using bag-of-words representation of their strings, since we had no other way of matching them to Freebase entities. All Reverb relationships were encoded using bag-of-words of their strings. Using this approximate process, we are able to store each Reverb fact as a bag-of-symbols (words or Freebase entities) all already seen by the MemNN during its training phase based on Freebase. We can then hope that what had been learned there could also be successfully used to query Reverb facts.

Output module

The output module performs the memory lookups given the input to return the supporting facts destined to eventually provide the answer given a question. In our case of simple QA, this module only returns a single supporting fact. To avoid scoring all the stored facts, we first perform an approximate entity linking step to generate a small set of candidate facts. The supporting fact is the candidate fact that is most similar to the question according to an embedding model.

Candidate generation

To generate candidate facts, we match n-grams of words of the question to aliases of Freebase entities and select a few matching entities. All facts having one of these entities as subject are scored in a second step.

We first generate all possible n-grams from the question, removing those that contain an interrogative pronoun or 1-grams that belong to a list of stopwords. We only keep the n-grams which are an alias of an entity, and then discard all n-grams that are a subsequence of another n-gram, except if the longer n-gram only differs by in, of, for or the at the beginning. We finally keep the two entities with the most links in Freebase retrieved for each of the five longest matched n-grams.

Scoring

Scoring is performed using an embedding model. Given two embedding matrices [formula] and [formula], which respectively contain, in columns, the d-dimensional embeddings of the words/n-grams of the vocabulary and the embeddings of the Freebase entities and relationships, the similarity between question q and a Freebase candidate fact y is computed as: with  cos () the cosine similarity. When scoring a fact y from Reverb, we use the same embeddings and build the matrix [formula], which contains the concatenation in columns of [formula] and [formula], and also compute the cosine similarity: The dimension d is a hyperparameter, and the embedding matrices [formula] and [formula] are the parameters learned with the training algorithm of Section [\ref=sec:training].

Response module

In Memory Networks, the Response module post-processes the result of the Output module to compute the intended answer. In our case, it returns the set of objects of the selected supporting fact.

Training

This section details how we trained the scoring function of the Output module using a multitask training process on four different sources of data.

First, in addition to the new SimpleQuestions dataset described in Section [\ref=sec:fbq], we also used WebQuestions, a benchmark for QA introduced in [\cite=berant-EtAl:2013:EMNLP]: questions are labeled with answer strings from aliases of Freebase entities, and many questions expect multiple answers. Table [\ref=tab:data] details the statistics of both datasets.

We also train on automatic questions generated from the KB, that is FB2M or FB5M depending on the setting, which are essential to learn embeddings for the entities not appearing in either WebQuestions or SimpleQuestions. Statistics of FB2M or FB5M are given in Table [\ref=tab:kbs]; we generated one training question per fact following the same process as that used in [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014].

Following previous work such as [\cite=paralex], we also use the indirect supervision signal of pairs of question paraphrases. We used a subset of the large set of paraphrases extracted from WikiAnswers and introduced in [\cite=fader2014open]. Our Paraphrases dataset is made of 15M clusters containing 2 or more paraphrases each.

Multitask training

As in previous work on embedding models and Memory Networks [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014] [\cite=bordes2014open] [\cite=weston2014memory], the embeddings are trained with a ranking criterion. For QA datasets the goal is that in the embedding space, a supporting fact is more similar to the question than any other non-supporting fact. For the paraphrase dataset, a question should be more similar to one of its paraphrases than to any another question.

The multitask learning of the embedding matrices [formula] and [formula] is performed by alternating stochastic gradient descent (SGD) steps over the loss function on the different datasets. For the QA datasets, given a question/supporting fact pair (q,y) and a non-supporting fact y', we perform a step to minimize the loss function where + is the positive part and γ is a margin hyperparameter. For the paraphrase dataset, the similarity score between two questions q and q' is also the cosine between their embeddings, i.e. [formula], and given a paraphrase pair (q,q') and another question q'', the loss is: The embeddings (i.e. the columns of [formula] and [formula]) are projected onto the L2 unit ball after each update. At each time step, a sample from the paraphrase dataset is drawn with probability 0.2 (this probability is arbitrary). Otherwise, a sample from one of the three QA datasets, chosen uniformly at random, is taken. We use the WARP loss [\cite=wsabie] to speed up training, and Adagrad [\cite=duchi2011adaptive] as SGD algorithm multi-threaded with HogWild! [\cite=recht2011hogwild]. Training takes 2-3 hours on 20 threads.

Training sources

The challenge of simple QA is to obtain a high coverage of answerable questions, and in particular to avoid overfitting specific question patterns that might appear on a particular dataset. To that end, we train on four different sources of data. The first two datasets are the new SimpleQuestions dataset described at length in Section [\ref=sec:fbq] and WebQuestions, the standard benchmark for QA. Introduced in [\cite=berant-EtAl:2013:EMNLP], WebQuestions is decomposed in train/validation/test sets with respectively 3,000, 778 and 2,032 trivia questions. Questions are labeled with answer strings from aliases of Freebase entities, and many questions expect multiple answers. Table [\ref=tab:data] details the statistics of these datasets.

We also train on two additional datasets: a large set of synthetic questions/supporting fact pairs generated from Freebase, and the set of paraphrases introduced by [\cite=fader2014open]. Automatic questions generated from the KB, that is FB2M or FB5M depending on the setting, are essential to learn non-random embeddings for the entities not seen during training. Statistics of FB2M or FB5M are given in Table [\ref=tab:kbs]; we generated one training question per fact following the same process used in [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014]. Following many previous works such as [\cite=paralex] or [\cite=bordes2014open], we also study the influence of multi-tasking the training with an indirect supervision signal made of pairs of question paraphrases. We used a subset of the large set of question paraphrases extracted from the WikiAnswers website and introduced in [\cite=fader2014open]. Our final Paraphrases dataset is made of 15,189,550 clusters containing 2 or more paraphrases each.

Distant supervision

Unlike for SimpleQuestions or the synthetic QA data generated from Freebase, for WebQuestions only answer strings are provided for questions: the supporting facts are unknown.

In order to generate the supervision, we use the candidate fact generation algorithm of Section [\ref=sec:outputModule]. For each candidate fact, the aliases of its objects are compared to the set of provided answer strings. The fact(s) which can generate the maximum number of answer strings from their objects' aliases are then kept. If multiple facts are obtained for the same question, the ones with the minimal number of objects are considered as supervision facts. This last selection avoids favoring irrelevant relationships that would be kept only because they point to many objects but would not be specific enough. If no answer string could be found from the objects of the initial candidates, the question is discarded from the training set.

Future work should investigate the process of weak supervised training of MemNNs recently introduced in [\cite=sukhbaatar2015weakly] that allows to train them without any supervision coming from the supporting facts.

Generating negative examples

As in [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014] [\cite=bordes2014open], learning is performed with gradient descent, so that negative examples (non-supporting facts or non-paraphrases) are generated according to a randomized policy during training.

For paraphrases, given a pair (q,q'), a non-paraphrase pair is generated as (q,q'') where q'' is a random question of the dataset, not belonging to the cluser of q. For question/supporting fact pairs, we use two policies. The default policy to obtain a non-supporting fact is to corrupt the answer fact by exchanging its subject, its relationship or its object(s) with that of another fact chosen uniformly at random from the KB. In this policy, the element of the fact to corrupt is chosen randomly, with a small probability (0.3) of corrupting more than one element of the answer fact. The second policy we propose, called candidates as negatives, is to take as non-supporting fact a randomly chosen fact from the set of candidate facts. While the first policy is standard in learning embeddings, the second one is more original, and, as we see in the experiments, gives slightly better performance.

Related Work

The first approaches to open-domain QA were search engine-based systems, where keywords extracted from the question are sent to a search engine, and the answer is extracted from the top results [\cite=yahya2012natural] [\cite=unger2012template]. This method has been adapted to KB-based QA [\cite=yahya2012natural] [\cite=unger2012template], and obtained competitive results with respect to semantic parsing and embedding-based approaches.

Semantic parsing approaches [\cite=cai-yates:2013:ACL2013] [\cite=berant-EtAl:2013:EMNLP] [\cite=kwiatkowski-EtAl:2013:EMNLP] [\cite=berant2014semantic] [\cite=fader2014open] perform a functional parse of the sentence that can be interpreted as a KB query. Even though these approaches are difficult to train at scale because of the complexity of their inference, their advantage is to provide a deep interpretation of the question. Some of these approaches require little to no question-answer pairs [\cite=paralex] [\cite=reddy2014large], relying on simple rules to tranform the semantic interpretation to a KB query.

Like our work, embedding-based methods for QA can be seen as simple MemNNs. The algorithms of [\cite=bordes2014open] [\cite=weston2014memory] use an approach similar to ours but are based on Reverb rather than Freebase, and relied purely on bag-of-word for both questions and facts. The approach of [\cite=yang2014joint] uses a different representation of questions, in which recognized entities are replaced by an entity token, and a different training data using entity mentions from Wikipedia. Our model is closest to the one presented in [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014], which is discussed in more details in the experiments.

Experiments

This section provides an extensive evaluation of our MemNNs implementation against state-of-the-art QA methods as well as an empirical study of the impact of using multiple training sources on the prediction performance.

Evaluation and baselines

Table [\ref=tab:data] details the dimensions of the test sets of WebQuestions, SimpleQuestions and Reverb which we used for evaluation. On WebQuestions, we evaluate against previous results on this benchmark [\cite=berant-EtAl:2013:EMNLP] [\cite=yao2014information] [\cite=berant2014semantic] [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014] [\cite=yang2014joint] in terms of F1-score as defined in [\cite=berant2014semantic], which is the average, over all test questions, of the F1-score of the sets of predicted answers. Since no previous result was published on SimpleQuestions, we only compare different versions of MemNNs. SimpleQuestions questions are labeled with their entire Freebase fact, so we evaluate in terms of path-level accuracy, in which a prediction is correct if the subject and the relationship were correctly retrieved by the system.

The Reverb test set, based on the KB of the same name and introduced in [\cite=paralex] is used for evaluation only. It contains 691 questions. We consider the task of re-ranking a small set of candidate answers, which are Reverb facts and are labeled as correct or incorrect. We compare our approach to the original system [\cite=paralex], to [\cite=bordes2014open] and to the original MemNNs [\cite=weston2014memory], in terms of accuracy, which is the percentage of questions for which the top-ranked candidate fact is correct.

Experimental setup

All models were trained with at least the dataset made of synthetic questions created from the KB. The hyperparameters were chosen to maximize the F1-score on WebQuestions validation set, independently of the testing dataset. The embedding dimension and the learning rate were chosen among {64,128,256} and {1,0.1,...,1.0e - 4} respectively, and the margin γ was set to 0.1. For each configuration of hyperparameters, the F1-score on the validation set was computed regularly during learning to perform early stopping.

We tested additional configurations for our algorithm. First, in the Candidates as Negatives setting (negative facts are sampled from the candidate set, see Section [\ref=sec:training]), abbreviated Cands As Negs, the experimental protocol is the same as in the default setting but the embeddings are initialized with the best configuration of the default setup. Second, our model shares some similarities with an approach studied in [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014], in which the authors noticed important gains using a subgraph representation of answers. For completeness, we also added such a subgraph representation of objects. In that setting, called Subgraph, each object o of a fact is itself represented as a bag-of-entities that encodes the immediate neighborhood of o. This Subgraph model is trained similarly as our main approach and only the results of a post-hoc ensemble combination of the two models (where the scores are added) are presented. We also report the results obtained by an ensemble of the 5 best models on validation (subgraph excepted); this is denoted 5 models.

Comparative Results -1

Table [\ref=tab:res] presents our experimental results: we display the performance of many previous work along with those of our MemNNs architecture trained in various conditions.

MemNNs can reach state-of-the-art on WebQuestions by either using a subgraph model or an ensemble of 5 models. This is 3 more points that the previous best performing embedding model on the same benchmark [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014]. Each evolution we propose here compared to [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014] contributes to this increase:

Removing mediator nodes in Freebase and relaxing the string matching allow to reach more answers within 1-hop. No need for 2-hops anymore and many more questions become "simple". This grants a much faster inference.

Grouping facts is also important for scalability (it reduces the candidate set size by an order of magnitude) and accuracy. MemNNs here can reach 36.2 with the same KB as used in [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014] and no subgraph. Since SimpleQuestions does not seem to bring anything when testing on WebQuestions, this can be compared to 35.3, the performance of [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014] without subgraph, except that we do not have to perform inference within 2-hops. With similar KB, our model scales better and is actually more accurate.

Since our model scales well, we can apply it easily to a bigger version of Freebase, FB5M, which has a much higher connectivity. This allows to bring much more answers within the immediate neighborhood of the entities identified by string-matching in the questions, making much more questions easily solvable. On WebQuestions, not specifically designed for being a simple QA dataset,  85% of the questions can be solved by retrieving a single fact. It was not obvious, but for MemNNs, exploding the size of the KB, leads to much better performance (not on SimpleQuestions, but its design one was based on FB2M).

All these remarks do not only apply to embedding models or Memory Networks but to any QA systems: the more direct connections exist within the KB, the easier the task of answering becomes.

They can enjoy multi-tasking in the sense that a MemNN trained on multiple sources ( WebQuestions, SimpleQuestions and Paraphrases) is as good or slightly better on the various test sets compared to models trained on the corresponding training sets alone. There is no destructive interaction. Even if WebQuestions and SimpleQuestions are boh based on Freebase, they seem quite different since training on one does not transfer very well into improved performance on the other.

On WebQuestions and SimpleQuestions, the weak signal coming from Paraphrases allows to improve slightly only when the corresponding training set is not provided. Otherwise the supervised signal, being much stronger, seems to cancel that. Hence, Paraphrases are especially interesting to get a broader coverage

Results

Comparative results

The results of the comparative experiments are given in Table [\ref=tab:res]. On the main benchmark WebQuestions, our best results use all data sources, the bigger extract from Freebase and the Cands As Negs setting. The two ensembles achieve excellent results, with F1-scores of 41.9% and 42.2% respectively. The best published competing approach [\cite=yang2014joint] has an F1-score of 41.3%, which is comparable to a single run of our model (41.2%). On the new SimpleQuestions dataset, the best models achieve 62 - 63% accuracy, while the supporting fact is in the candidate set for about 86% of SimpleQuestions questions. This shows that MemNNs are effective at re-ranking the candidates, but also that simple QA is still not solved.

Our approach bares similarity to [\cite=bordes-chopra-weston:2014:EMNLP2014] - using path. They use FB2M, and so their result (35.3% F1-score on WebQuestions) should be compared to our 36.2%. The models are slightly different in that they replace the entity string with the subject entity in the question representation and that we use the cosine similarity instead of the dot product, which gave consistent improvements. Still, the major differences come from how we use Freebase. First, the removal of the mediator nodes allows us to restrict ourselves to single supporting facts, while they search in paths of length 2 with a heuristic to select the paths to follow (otherwise, inference is too costly), which makes our inference simpler and more efficient. Second, using grouped facts, we integrate multiple answers during learning (through the distant supervision), while they use a grouping heuristic at test time. Grouping facts also allows us to scale much better and to train on FB5M. On WebQuestions, not specifically designed as a simple QA dataset, 86% of the questions can now be answered with a single supporting fact, and performance increases significantly (from 36.2% to 41.0% F1-score). Using the bigger FB5M as KB does not change performance on SimpleQuestions because it was based on FB2M, but the results show that our model is robust to the addition of more entities than necessary.

Transfer learning on Reverb

In this set of experiments, all Reverb facts are added to the memory, without any retraining, and we test our ability to rerank answers on the companion QA set. Thus, Table [\ref=tab:res] (last column) presents the result of our model without training on Reverb  against methods specifically developed on that dataset. Our best results are 67% accuracy (and 68% for the ensemble of 5 models), which are better than the 54% of the original paper and close to the state-of-the-art 73% of [\cite=bordes2014open]. These results show that the Memory Network approach can integrate and use new entities and links.

Importance of data sources

The bottom half of Table [\ref=tab:res] presents the results on the three datasets when our model is trained with different data sources. We first notice that models trained on a single QA dataset perform poorly on the other datasets (e.g. 46.6% accuracy on SimpleQuestions for the model trained on WebQuestions only), which shows that the performance on WebQuestions does not necessarily guarantee high coverage for simple QA. On the other hand, training on both datasets only improves performance; in particular, the model is able to capture all question patterns of the two datasets; there is no "negative interaction".

While paraphrases do not seem to help much on WebQuestions and SimpleQuestions, except when training only with synthetic questions, they have a dramatic impact on the performance on Reverb. This is because WebQuestions and SimpleQuestions questions follow simple patterns and are well formed, while Reverb questions have more syntactic and lexical variability. Thus, paraphrases are important to avoid overfitting on specific question patterns of the training sets.

Conclusion

This paper presents an implementation of MemNNs for the task of large-scale simple QA. Our results demonstrate that, if properly trained, MemNNs are able to handle natural language and a very large memory (millions of entries), and hence can reach state-of-the-art on the popular benchmark WebQuestions.

We want to emphasize that many of our findings, especially those regarding how to format the KB, do not only concern MemNNs but potentially any QA system. This paper also introduced the new dataset SimpleQuestions, which, with 100k examples, is one order of magnitude bigger than WebQuestions: we hope that it will foster interesting new research in QA, simple or not.
