% APJPT4.STY -- ApJ plano tables style.

% Plano tables are camera-ready pages that are included in a typeset
% article the same way as line drawings, graphs, and other camera-ready
% art, i.e., as "planographic" figures.  This file is parameterized so
% that the tables are appropriate for the ApJ.

% My convention for identifying configuration information is for styles
% to define the five parameters below.

\def\@tightleading{1.1}

% Double-space by default.  Observe that you double-space in LaTeX by
% resetting \baselinestretch, which is essentially a scale factor for
% \baselineskip (= leading, for you typographophiles).  The style uses
% the \@doubleleading factor, defined above.

%\def\baselinestretch{\@doubleleading}

% The \tighten command merely resets the \baselinestretch to a
% smaller factor, resulting in single-column text that is more closely
% spaced.  (This will always work.)  Tightening the vertical spacing
% in the text results in output that is more attractive for distribution
% to colleagues who are primarily interested in reading the paper, as
% opposed to copy editing it.  Double-spaced output for referees and
% copy editors is, however, the main objective of this style, hence
% double-spacing occurs by default.  The same effect as \tighten
% can be achieved by using the "tighten" document style option.

% be followed by its own \affil (or address).
%
% Authors often have affiliations above and beyond their main employer,
% and these are specified with the \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext commands.
% These commands behave like the \footnotemark and \footnotetext commands
% of LaTeX.  \altaffilmark is appended to author's names in the \author
% lists, and generates the superscript identification numbers.
% The text for the individual alternate affiliations is generated by the

% alternate affiliation.

% Bibliography/references environment.  For the time being, I don't think
% it would be a good idea to force an implementation based on BibTeX,
% although I'll prepare for that eventuality by using the constructs and
% general ideas of the LaTeX thebibliography environment.  Adjustments
% have been made so that the \cite-\bibitem mechanism can be used to cite
% references symbolically while maintaining proper citation syntax within
% the paper; the author must create the citation label for each reference
% in proper journal format in the \bibitem command.
%
%    \begin{thebibliography}
%    \bibitem[LABEL]{TEXTTAG} \reference <bibliographic data>
%    \end{thebibliography}
%
% where LABEL must adhere to the journal's standards, e.g. "Abt 1986".
%
% It is not necessary to use the thebibliography environment.  This style
% defines a references environment that simply sets off the list of references
% and adjusts spacing parameters.  It is not possible to use \bibitems
% within the references environment.  (The \reference command cannot be

% Observe that the bibliographic data supplied by the author must also
% conform to the standards of the journal.  I have elected not to burden
% authors with tedious LaTeX commands which would require many curly braces
% to delimit the bibliographic fields because many of the journals I have
% targeted in this project have agreed to reduce typographic overhead (bolding,
% italicizing, etc.) in reference lists.  (See Abt's editorial in ApJ 357.)
% It is the responsibility of the author to get these fields in the proper
% order with the correct punctuation; the information will be typeset as is,
% i.e., in roman with no size or style changes.
%
% Macros are provided for many of the oft-referenced journals so that authors
% may use the LaTeX names rather than having to look up a particular journal's
% specific abbreviation.  In principle, all the journals should be using the
% same abbreviations, too, but I anticipate some changes in the specific
% abbreviations before a set is finally settled on.  As long as these macros
% are kept up to date, authors need not be concerned about such editorial
% changes.
%
% Corresponding with the non-BibTeX references environment and \reference
% command for the reference list is the \markcite command.  This can be
% used to identify in-text citations; in this case, the author provides
% the actual citation text as opposed to the symbolic tag.  The use of
% this is encouraged, even for journals where no special formatting of
% citation call-outs is required; it is crucial for the future use of
% on-line browsers.

% Footnotes for tables are to be identified with lower case alphabetics,
% rather than numeric.  \tablenotemark and \tablenotetext commands are
% provided analogous to \footnotemark and \footnotetext, but with the
% identifier *required*, like \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext.  The
% \tablenotetext must be specified before the \end{table}, since
% \end{table} displays it.

%     \tablenotetext{ALPHA TAG}{TEXT}
%
% Note that TAG LETTER == ALPHA TAG for corresponding text.  It is the
% responsibility of the author to get the correspondence correct.
%
% The table footnotes are coupled to the table in which they occur, rather
% than being associated with a particular page, and they are printed with
% the table (relatively close to the caption) instead of appearing at the
% extreme bottom of the page.  This is done to ensure that the notes wind
% up on the same page as the table, since tables are floats and can migrate
% from one page to another.  There is the additional benefit that the notes
% are unambiguously attached to the proper table, which is what is required
% in the event that the editorial requirement of one table only per page
% is ever changed to permit several tables per page.
%
% Footnotes are NOT supported for figures.

% Handy little things everybody works out for themselves anyway.  Many
% of these come from Springer's A&A package, and some were contributed
% by Francois Schweizer at DTM.  You can go berserk making these up,
% especially when you start getting into the composite ones.  We have
% tried to select a tractable number that were useful, and somewhat
% difficult to get right because fussy kerning or some such is required.
% Most can be used in or out of math mode with impunity; \alt and \agt
% are relations and can only be used in math mode.
