% TIGHTEN.STY -- Substyle definition for "single-spaced" manuscripts.

% This is the least intrusive way to implement a substyle layered on top
% the standard LaTeX styles: by creating a foo.sty style that is read when
% the specifies the document substyle foo.  This file is read in when
%
%    \documentstyle[12pt,aasms,tighten]{article}
%
% is specified by the author.

\tighten

% That's all this files does.  It would be more efficient to have "tighten"
% declared as an internal substyle, but that requires modifications in the
% main LaTeX article.sty file.
